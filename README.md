Topic: **Automating the Creation of Bias Lexica**

Our objective is to automate the process of creating bias lexica, and using this automatically generated bias lexica to classify biased statements using a supervised learning algorithm. In our project, we will use _word2vec_ word embedding method to extract biased words from the dataset, then this extracted biased words will be used as seeds to extract more biased words to effectively generate a comprehensive lexicon of biased words.

### Plan
Our initial approach to create a lexicon of biased words is outlined in the following figure.

This process is further explained in our [initial report](https://github.com/harshildarji/TMP-SS-2020/blob/master/intermediate-reports/initial_report.pdf).
