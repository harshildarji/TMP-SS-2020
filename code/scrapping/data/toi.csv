BS Yediyurappa: Hunt on to find BS Yediyurappa’s successor,"BS Yediyurappa

BENGALURU: The BJP top brass has a tough task on hand — hunting for an “acceptable” successor to 78-year-old Lingayat strongman and chief minister BS Yediyurappa whenever he decides to hang up his boots.It’s a challenge for the party leadership in New Delhi, with none of the second-rung leaders showing enough promise to fill the old warhorse’s shoes. Yediyurappa will complete one year in office this July in his fourth innings as CM.“Karnataka BJP minus Yediyurappa is like a square peg in a round hole. But it has become imperative for the party to find an alternative leader before he fades into the political sunset. But whoever succeeds Yediyurappa should be a Lingayat to get instant acceptance,” said a senior party functionary.When the BJP government came to power in last July, the leadership appointed three second-rung leaders — Laxman Savadi (Lingayat) Govind Karjol (SC) and CN Ashwath Narayan (Vokkaliga) as deputy chief ministers — overlooking several seniors purportedly to groom a successor to Yediyurappa. But the trio has struggled to come out of the septuagenarian’s shadow.There’s dissatisfaction in the party over Yediyurappa’s style of functioning. The BJP leadership, though aware of the internal bickering, is treading cautiously as its attempt more than a decade ago ended in a disaster. It’s also aware that it can ill afford to lose support of Lingayat community, its core vote bank.Sources privy to inside developments say the central leadership has now “opened the forum” on the succession plan, keeping the 2023 assembly polls in mind. Karnataka is also significant since it’s BJP’s gateway to the south.Sources said the party has zeroed in on a few names and things will become clear after Rajya Sabha polls on June 21. Though the names of Lingayat leaders Jagadish Shettar, V Somanna, Basavaraj Bommai and Murgesh Nirani are doing the rounds, the party still doesn’t seem convinced that they’ll be able to take forward Yediyurappa’s legacy. Two other names which have been added to the list include Vijayapura MLA Basannagouda Patil Yatnal and Dharwad West MLA Aravind Bellad as they both belong to powerful sects of the Lingayat community.Yatnal’s strong RSS roots and his experience as Union minister may help him though his motormouth image may play spoilsport. Bellad, 50, is being perceived as the Devendra Fadnavis of Karnataka. Non-Lingayat names doing the rounds include Pralhad Joshi (Union minister) and S Suresh Kumar (both Brahmins), R Ashoka (Vokkaliga) and Aravind Limbavalli (SC), many of whom have the strong support of RSS. Yediyurappa himself is said to be pitching for his younger son BY Vijayendra, who is facing opposition’s allegations of being de-facto CM, but the question is whether he will have the backing of senior MLAs.","Yediyurappa will complete one year in office this July in his fourth innings as CM.“Karnataka BJP minus Yediyurappa is like a square peg in a round hole.

‘Cases against Lallu politically motivated’,"Lucknow: The Congress party on Sunday said that cases against UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu were politically motivated and demanded immediate withdrawal of fake cases and release of Lallu from jail.

“Lallu was booked for helping migrant workers and labourers returning to their homes in UP. The entire act of putting him in jail shows the high high-handedness of the UP government,” said senior party leader Rajeev Shukla in an online interaction with mediapersons. He was referring to the buses' row between the UP government and Congress leadership.

On a question related to a ‘confrontational politics between the Congress and the BJP’, Shukla stated: “There is no confrontation with the state government. From the time we applied for permission, our intention was just to help migrants. We did not indulge in politics of any kind.”

“He was arrested twice – first in Agra where he sat on a demonstration to protest delay in granting of permission to allow entry of buses in the state. He was allowed to go after bail. But before he could leave, he was re-arrested in connection with the Congress’ standoff with the state government. Such a misconduct by the state government with a two-time MLA is undemocratic and uncalled for,” said Congress legislature party leader Aradhana Mishra.

Congress leader from western UP Pankaj Malik, against whom a case has been registered for bringing buses to Noida, said, “We are not afraid of any case, we will fight it out.”

Yumnam Khemchand Singh: Opposition submits notice for removal of assembly speaker,"Manipur assembly speaker Yumnam Khemchand Singh. (ANI photo)

GUWAHATI: Firing its first salvo against the BJP-led Manipur government after the withdrawal of support by nine MLAs from two allies and its own ranks on Wednesday, a stronger state opposition on Thursday sent a notice of motion to the state assembly secretary for removal of speaker Yumnam Khemchand Singh under Article 179 (e) of the Constitution of India.

The notice has been served by Congress legislator K Meghachandra Singh with 10 signatories in support of the motion, which include the leader of the opposition and former chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh, former deputy chief minister in the BJP-led coalition government and NPP leader Y Joykumar Singh.

The notice states, “This motion for removal of the speaker of the Manipur, legislative assembly is necessitated for the removal that the Hon'ble speaker has conducted himself in a manner unbecoming of the position held by him and his actions are not only unconstitutional but also illegal, which is in reference to the matter of disqualification of the seven Congress legislators, who have been barred by Manipur high court on June 8 from entering the state legislative assembly house until the disqualification case pending in the speaker’s tribunal is disposed of finally.

These seven MLAs who had won Congress ticket had defected to BJP soon after the 2017 assembly election.

Meghachandra Singh in his notice stated, “The next date for proceedings on the decision of the honorable speaker regarding the disqualification of 7 members of the legislative assembly, belonging to the Congress Party, was to be taken on June 22 as fixed by the speaker himself. However, by his communication released in the social media to the hon'ble members of the Manipur legislative assembly at 11pm on June 17, the decision regarding the disqualification of the aforementioned members is preponed without reasonable explanation to June 18. Thereby, the honourable speaker has conducted himself in an authoritarian manner which is opposed to the well-established practice and procedure of the house rooted in democratic principle. Therefore, please accept this notice for the removal of the speaker of the Manipur legislative assembly and the motion for leave to move the resolution for removal of the speaker may kindly be entered in the list of business in the name of the undersigned.”

Political parties condemn state government,"Coimbatore: As large number of people queued up in front of Tasmac shops on the first day of their reopening, members of several political parties took to the streets in several parts of the district on Thursday to condemn the state government’s move. They came out wearing masks and ensured physical distancing as they staged protests.

DMK MLA N Karthik said, “What’s the need to open state-run liquor shops when Covid-19 positive cases are on the rise? If the public fail to ensure physical distancing norms at the outlets, it would further lead to a spike in infection.” He, along with other DMK cadres, staged protest at Anna Nagar in Peelamdu.

Pointing out that representatives of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) had requested the district administration to permit them to reopen their units a few days ago, the Singanallur legislator said officials had then turned down their request even after they assured to run the units with minimal workforce. “How safe would liquor shops be than MSME units?”

He said the tipplers would now spend more on liquor, putting the financial stability of their families at risk. “Its impact could be felt in the society in a few days.”

K S Kanagaraj, district secretary, Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI), said it was not the right time to reopen liquor shops. Pressing their demands, DYFI members have sent thousands of emails to the state government.

He said the state government was yet to receive its share of Goods and Service Tax (GST) from the Centre. “If the state is facing financial crisis, it should look for ways to get its pending fund from the Centre, instead of trying to collect it from the public by way of liquor sales.”

He said only a few workers have managed to find a job that too after a long gap. “Now that the Tasmac outlets are open, most of them are likely to spend their earnings on liquor, instead of using that to take care of their family members.”

Demanding fund to the state to intensify Covid-19 preventive measures and Rs5,000 for the families that had lost employment due to lockdown from the central government, members of the CPI and the CPM staged protests in the city. They also condemned the state government for reopening the liquor shops. While the CPM members, led by MP P R Natrajan, held black umbrella protest at Gandhipuram, CPI members, led by district secretary S V Sundaram, conducted black flag protest at the district party headquarters.

Ashiq Mohammed, district deputy secretary, Manithaneya Makkal Katchi (MMK), said, “It has been one of our long pending demands to close liquor shops in the state as it has negative impact on the public. But the state government, which has been hesitating to reopen religious places, has today opened liquor shops. How fair is this?” The MMK members staged protest at 19 places, including Ukkadam, Karumbukadai, Kuniyamuthur and Singanallur, in the district.

Ceferin singled out Manchester City's England forward Raheem Sterling, Real Madrid's Brazilian full back Marcelo and Bayern Munich's German defender Jerome Boateng for speaking out on racism.

""I am proud of the fact that footballers are leading some of today's most important international debates,"" Ceferin told a video news conference after a UEFA meeting.

""Football really can be an important vehicle for good and these examples demonstrate that.""

He also praised Manchester United's Marcus Rashford after the England forward's successful campaign for school food vouchers to be provided over the summer holidays in Britain.

After originally saying school food vouchers would not be available over the long summer holiday, British ministers bowed to pressure after 22-year-old Rashford took up the cause and revealed how he had relied on such support as a boy.

""We know the power of football is huge so we should use that for good messages,"" said Ceferin, who also reflected on UEFA's attempts to tackle racism.

""Probably those campaigns we had were not enough, we tried hard but I think we should go to the next level,"" he said. ""We know the situation is serious and it gets more serious every day.""

‘CM playing politics with volunteering’,"Saligao: Social activists from Mapusa are irked over chief minister Pramod Sawant’s decision to allow only elected representative to act as volunteers to undertake delivery of essentials to people during the 21-day lockdown.

Accusing him of denying civilians the right to volunteer, they said the CM should not bring politics into play at such a time. The fight against the deadly coronavirus (Covid-19) should be fought unitedly, without any politics, they said.

Siolim-based Rajan Ghate said Sawant should realise that he is the CM of the state and not of BJP members alone. “We have been working for the people. Sawant should consider our demand as we are used to volunteering our services,” he said.

Many activists had already submitted their applications for volunteering on March 25 when the government suddenly came up with the idea of appointing only MLAs, panchayat members and councilors as volunteers.

Another activist, Shekar Naik, said his application has been lying pending with the authorities. “I cannot understand how just these elected representatives will be sufficient to cater to the needs of so many households,” he said.

“There is a lot of ongoing politics going in the appointment of volunteers. The rejection of our applications is proof of this,” Mapusa-based activist, Pravin Asolkar said.

"In jail, Lalu still a force in state politics","PATNA: “Jab tak rahega samosa mein aloo, tabtak rehega Bihar mein Lalu (I will be in Bihar till there is potato in samosa),” he once said about himself. Lalu turned 73 on Thursday.

The maverick politician known for his sense of humour and witty one-liners is serving jail term in fodder scam cases since December 2017. Yet he remains the most feared opposition politician for the ruling NDA in Bihar and their main target ahead of the assembly elections due in October-November.

Is it because Lalu out on parole or bail, like a ‘Djinn’ (ghost) out of confinement, will win back the extremely backward caste (EBC) and other backward caste (OBC) votes, which CM Nitish Kumar has assiduously nurtured since ending the RJD’s 15-year rule in 2005?

Though Lalu’s lawyer Prabhat Kumar told TOI over phone from Ranchi that he had no immediate plans to pursue Lalu’s bail matter, he did not rule out any such possibility either. Nitish, in his first virtual meeting with JD(U) workers on Sunday, asked them to tell the youths of Bihar about the “jungle raj of ‘pati-patni’ (Lalu and Rabri Devi) when people even feared to tread outside their homes after sunset”. Political analysts see Nitish’s appeal to his party workers in the context of then JD(U) national vice-president Prashant Kishor’s remarks that ‘Generation Z’ is not even aware of “Lalu-Rabri raj” and it would be of no use raking up the issue in the coming elections.

NDA under Nitish’s leadership has chosen to fight the 2020 polls on 15 years of RJD “jungle raj” versus 15 years of NDA rule of “development with justice”, which, Nitish says, has pulled Bihar out of ‘bhay’ (fear) and established ‘bharosa’ (trust) in society”. Nitish refers to the “pati-patni” rule almost daily in his virtual meetings since June 7. Even Union home minister Amit Shah targeted Lalu and obliquely his heir apparent Tejashwi Prasad Yadav in his first virtual rally on June 7.

For Nitish, Tejashwi is not his match. And he had made this clear when he had cajolingly told his former deputy on the floor of the assembly last session to sit down “Apke pitaji bolte to achcha lagta. Aap baith jaiye (I would have liked it had your father (Lalu) said this. Please sit down,” Nitish had told Tejashwi the leader of opposition.

Why Lalu still matters so much for the ruling combine when his son Tejashwi is leading the opposition alliance, asks senior RJD leader Abdul Bari Siddiqui and himself answers it. “It’s Lalu phobia which haunts those who believe in status quo. They are scared of Lalu because he will raise the issues related to the poor and creamy layer in reservation. Lalu never compromised with social justice. Why no one talks about Srijan scam, Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi, but only reminds people of fodder scam? Talk to the migrant workers and they will say had Lalu been there, they would not have faced such hardships in returning home from other states due to the lockdown and coronavirus,” Siddiqui told TOI on Thursday.

RJD MP and party spokesperson Manoj Jha said even after 15 years if JDU and BJP have to bring in Lalu ji, this simply shows the hollowness of their achievements. “Nitish ji or Sushil Modi ji (BJP) must thank Laluji. Had he not come to power, their political character might have been different. They (NDA) should not forget that in 15 years, a whole new generation has come up with own aspirations. BJP-JD(U) combine has summarily failed to address or even understand those aspirations.

“People now ask why the state failed its own migrant workforce for over a month? Why it criminalized them? Why the government is clueless about huge unemployment scenario? And yes, whether Laluji is there during the elections or not shall depend on the legal procedure. But his name causes enough anxieties for our opponents,” Manoj told TOI.

","PATNA: “Jab tak rahega samosa mein aloo, tabtak rehega Bihar mein Lalu (I will be in Bihar till there is potato in samosa),” he once said about himself.

Resort politics: Gujarat Congress moving MLAs to Rajasthan,"Representational Image

AHMEDABAD: Hit by three resignations in its legislative rank in a week, the Congress in Gujarat is shifting all its MLAs to a resort in Abu Road in party-ruled Rajasthan, alleging the ruling BJP was indulging in horse- trading ahead of the June 19 polls for four Rajya Sabha seats.

More than 20 Congress MLAs have already arrived at the resort, a party source said on Monday.

He said all party MLAs are being shifted to a single resort at Abu Road in Sirohi district of Rajasthan, not far from the Gujarat border in Banaskantha district.

After the resignations of three MLAs last week, the Congress, whose strength has been reduced to 65 in the 182- member House, had earlier moved its legislators to various resorts in Gujarat, dividing them in zone-wise groups starting Saturday.

The opposition party has now changed its strategy and is moving all its legislators to Abu Road, located near the popular hill station of Mount Abu.

The shifting of MLAs to Congress-ruled Rajasthan will allow the party to focus on drawing up its strategy for the crucial Rajya Sabha elections for which it has fielded two candidates, the source said.

""The party has decided to move all the MLAs at one place, to the resort at Sirohi in Rajasthan where they will stay till they are brought back to vote in the Rajya Sabha elections on June 19.

""Several MLAs have already arrived at the resort, while the remaining will reach there by Monday evening,"" the party source said.

Until Sunday night, more than 20 MLAs, mainly from the north Gujarat region, were shifted to the resort in the neighbouring state, he said.

The Congress had in March also taken its MLAs to a resort in Jaipur after five party legislators resigned before the March 26 Rajya Sabha polls , which were subsequently postponed due to the coronavirus lockdown.

The Congress has hit out at the BJP government in Gujarat, accusing it of misusing state machinery for ""threatening and horse-trading"" people's representatives.

The BJP has refuted the allegations of horse-trading.

On Sunday, a police complaint was filed for alleged violation of lockdown rules against a resort in Rajkot district where the Congress had lodged some of its MLAs.

The police registered an FIR against the owner and manager of Neelcity Resort in Rajkot under Indian Penal Code Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) for opening the resort for Congress MLAs in alleged violation of the lockdown notification which does not allow hotels and restaurants to reopen till Monday (June 8).

Last week, three Congress MLAs - Akshay Patel, Jitu Chaudhary and Brijesh Merja - had resigned from the assembly membership.

Before that, five Congress MLAs - Pravin Maru, Pradyumnasinh Jadeja, Soman Patel, JV Kakidia and Mangal Gavit - had resigned in March.

The BJP, having 103 MLAs, has fielded Abhay Bhardwaj, Ramilaben Bara and Narhari Amin as its candidates for elections to the Upper House of Parliament.

With the reduced strength of 65, the Congress may find it difficult to win two Rajya Sabha seats for which it has fielded Bharatsinh Solanki and Shaktisinh Gohil.

A Congress MLA said Solanki remains the second preference after Gohil, and that they will vote as per the directive of the party.

Besides the BJP and the Congress, the 182-member Assembly also has two MLAs of the Bharatiya Tribal Party, one of the NCP and an Independent legislator, Jignesh Mevani.

The effective strength of the House, however, stands at 172 as of now as 10 seats are currently vacant - two due to court cases and the rest because of resignations.","More than 20 Congress MLAs have already arrived at the resort, a party source said on Monday.

Return of 'resort politics' signalled impending political storm in MP,"This story is from March 10, 2020

BENGALURU: The 'resort politics' of huddling legislators in a far away location, which ususally precedes a political storm, has made a comeback with the arrival of rebel Congress MLAs here from Madhya Pradesh and it heralded the impending political crisis there.

As 21 legislators belonging to the Jyotiraditya Scindia camp resigned on Tuesday putting the Chief Minister Kamal Nath-led government in a spot, the arrival of eight legislators here on March 4 was the first sign that all was not well.

Amid allegations of poaching by BJP, they had landed in the city on Wednesday last and were put up in an undisclosed location.

According to sources, eight legislators including one independent were camping in the city for a week now. Out of them two- one Congress and an independent- had gone back.

""Later, the lawmakers here were joined by 13 legislators, who landed in the city by a chartered flight yesterday. So 19 are here,"" the sources said.

All MLAs are said to be loyal to expelled party leader Jyotiraditya Scindia.

These MLAs on Tuesday sent their resignation letters via e-mail to Raj Bhavan in Bhopal from Bengaluru.

All legislators are biding their time in the lush green environs of a sprawling resort here to make their next move.

Soothed by salubrious climate, the resort near the airport appears to be a perfect setting for the lesgislators to draw their next course of action.

The MLAs are out of bounds for the media.

Herding legislators to a resort is nevertheless a new phenomenon as such episodes had played out in the past as well in Karnataka and elsewhere.

Fearing possible poaching of MLAs by BJP, the Congress state unit here had moved its legislators to a resort in January 2019 which eventually set the stage for a rebellion last year.

In July 2019, the Congress and JD(S) MLAs from Karnataka were huddled in resorts at Mumbai and Goa that came to be known as 'Operation Lotus' which saw the coalition government led by former Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy being ousted.

Shaken with the coup of sorts, the Congress and the JD(S) went on the back foot and camped their remaining MLAs in a city based resort.

Prior to it, the Gujarat Congress had huddled its MLAs in a resort at Bidadi in Ramanagar district ahead of the Rajya Sabha elections.

Nepali Congress holds discussion on new political map,"KATHMANDU: The Nepali Congress , the main Opposition party, on Saturday discussed the Constitution amendment bill related to a new political map of the country put forth by the government in Parliament.

A proposal to this effect was put at the Central Working Committee (CWC) meeting that is currently underway at the party's headquarters in Sanepa .

According to Nepali Congress sources, the proposal put forth in the CWC meeting is related to the Constitution amendment bill that seeks to bring amendment to the political map included in Schedule 3 related to Article 9 (2) of the Constitution.

The party's CWC members are currently expressing their views on the proposal put forth in the meeting, they said.

Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Shivamaya Tumbahangphe was supposed to table the bill for discussion at Parliament on Wednesday.

However, the bill was removed from the parliamentary business schedule as per a request by the Nepali Congress to wait until the party could take a decision to this effect from its CWC meeting.

It requires a two-thirds majority vote in Parliament to bring an amendment to the Constitution.

Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli has decided to seek national consensus on the issue.

In the midst of a border dispute with India, Nepal recently released the revised political and administrative map of the country laying claim over the strategically key areas of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura.

India reacted angrily to the move saying such ""artificial enlargement"" of territorial claims will not be acceptable and asked the neighbouring country to refrain from such ""unjustified cartographic assertion"".

The ties between the two countries came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated a 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8.

Nepal reacted sharply to the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through Nepalese territory. India rejected the claim asserting that the road lies completely within its territory.

Nepalese Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali earlier this month summoned Indian Ambassador Vinay Mohan Kwatra and handed over a diplomatic note to protest against India inaugurating the key road.

However, Gyawali last week said that he was confident that the Kalapani issue between the two neighbours will be resolved through talks.

India on Thursday indicated its readiness to engage with Nepal to resolve the festering border row on the basis of mutual sensitivity and respect.

India is monitoring the current situation in Nepal, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said referring to Kathmandu deferring a plan to bring in a constitutional amendment to validate a new map that depicted Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as its territory

""India is open to engaging with all its neighbours on the basis of mutual sensitivity and mutual respect, in an environment of trust and confidence. This is a continuous process and requires constructive and positive efforts,"" Srivastava said.

The Lipulekh pass is a far western point near Kalapani, a disputed border area between Nepal and India. Both India and Nepal claim Kalapani as an integral part of their territory -- India as part of Uttarakhand's Pithoragarh district and Nepal as part of Dharchula district.

Twitter-Trump clash intensifies political misinformation battle,"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump 's threat to shut down social media companies after Twitter labeled two of his tweets misleading sets up a fresh challenge for platforms as they struggle to deal with political misinformation during a toxic election campaign.Twitter on Tuesday targeted tweets in which the president said that mail-in voting would lead to fraud and a ""rigged election"" in November, the first time the platform has placed a warning label on Trump's comments.The president's angry response and threat to ""strongly regulate"" or ""close down"" social media firms highlights the conundrum for Twitter and other platforms, said Steven Livingston, director of the Institute for Data, Democracy, and Politics at George Washington University.Livingston said he expects Twitter to narrowly enforce its misinformation policies, dealing only with specific issues such as the electoral process and the coronavirus pandemic.The attacks by Trump and his supporters put ""so much pressure (on Twitter) and they are blanching at the thought of taking the next step"" on curbing political misinformation, Livingston said.""They are caught on the horns of a dilemma and don't know which way to go.""Even while Twitter is pledging to foster a ""healthy conversation"" by filtering out hoaxes and toxic content, Livingston said the economic model for social platforms suggests the opposite.""Platforms know very well they are accentuating extremism,"" he said. ""Extremism holds attention and allows them to sell more advertising, and that's the whole point of the game.""When asked about Twitter's fact-checking during an interview on Fox News, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said his social network has a different policy.""I just believe strongly that Facebook should not be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online,"" Zuckerberg said in a snippet of the interview posted online by Fox.""I think, in general, private companies, especially these platform companies, shouldn't be in the position of doing that.""University of Texas social media researcher and professor Samuel Woolley nonetheless welcomed what he called ""a very bold move by Twitter"" in the face of political pressure.""Twitter will face a lot of backlash and whether they can bear up on this remains to be seen,"" Woolley said.Karen Kornbluh, head of the digital innovation and democracy initiative at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, said Twitter's action on content after it goes viral ""may be a case of closing the barn door after the horse is out -- but at least it communicates standards for acceptable activity on a platform's site and that no one is completely exempt.""The latest clash between Trump and Twitter comes with the president and his supporters complaining of what he calls bias by internet firms against conservatives -- despite his own vast social media following -- and threatening to use antitrust enforcement or other regulatory efforts against the companies.Daniel Kreiss, a professor and researcher at the University of North Carolina 's Center for Information, Technology, and Public Life, said Twitter ""made the right call"" in enforcing its policy on election misinformation without getting into the broader area of political speech or other topics, such as the president's murder conspiracy comments this week against a TV journalist.""Twitter is drawing a line in the sand on protecting electoral integrity, saying this outweighs anyone's right to use the platform any way they want,"" Kreiss said.""I think they're well justified. They have laid out clear values and a transparent policy.""Kreiss said the measured approach could allow Twitter to navigate a toxic election campaign without getting bogged down in political debate, but noted that ""they will be criticized whichever way they go.""Michelle Amazeen, a Boston University professor of political communication, called Twitter's move ""a much needed step forward"" but questioned how much impact this would have on misinformation on the platform.""Are Twitter users now going to believe that if there is no label, Trump's tweet is accurate? Research suggests they will,"" she said.Amazeen said Twitter's actions still fall short of establishing the same kinds of standards in force in most news outlets.""Twitter is not a reliable source for legitimate news,"" she said. ""Studies indicate that people who rely on social media for their news are more likely to be misinformed than people who go to mainstream news sources.""As to Trump's threats, legal experts say Trump has distorted the US constitution's free speech guarantees which protect against government-directed controls.""Thank goodness the First Amendment prevents him, or me or any other elected official from closing down speech platforms,"" Democratic lawmaker Ted Lieu tweeted.","""Even while Twitter is pledging to foster a ""healthy conversation"" by filtering out hoaxes and toxic content, Livingston said the economic model for social platforms suggests the opposite.

BJP plans protest; stop playing politics: NCP,"KOLHAPUR: State BJP chief Chandrakant Patil has announced a day-long state-wide agitation against the Uddhav Thackeray-led government on Friday while accusing it of “gross failure in curbing the spread of Covid-19”.Reacting to BJP’s call for agitation, Maharashtra NCP president Jayant Patil, who is also the state water resources minister, said that BJP should stay away from politics in times of coronavirus pandemic The BJP leader on Wednesday night said that the agitation would be held under the banner, ‘Mera Aangan, Mera Ranangan’ and appealed to party members and citizens to stand in balconies or courtyards of their houses wearing black clothes or wave black flags or cloth.“The chief minister of Maharashtra has quarantined himself at Matoshree and the state government is being run by bureaucrats,” Chandrakant Patil told reporters in Kolhapur.“It’s time citizens protested against the gross failure of the state government,” said Patil while justifying his call for the day-long agitation.The state BJP chief said that it was expected that the chief minister would lead the state from the front by hitting the ground wearing a mask, gloves and personal protection equipment (PPE), but Uddhav Thackeray has locked himself inside Matoshree.“How can one expect the common man to fight against coronavirus when the CM has shown no courage and is defensive in his approach”, he said.Patil said the party units in each district and city will decide on the time slots for the protest while taking into account the local situation and containment zone norms in each locality.Jayant Patil of the NCP hit back at the BJP on Thursday and said, “Our party never criticised PM Narendra Modi, who was busy attending to US president Donald Trump when coronavirus had already hit India.

Fadnavis must have the telephone number of Uddhav Thackeray. He should talk to him and make suggestions. That is what is needed now, and not politics,” he said.The NCP leader said that though the Maharashtra government made arrangements for transport of migrant workers to their respective states, many BJP-ruled states did not allow their own people to enter.“Instead of wasting time in agitations and publicity stunts, the state BJP leaders should ask their counterparts in other states to allow passage to these migrants,” the NCP leader added.","KOLHAPUR: State BJP chief Chandrakant Patil has announced a day-long state-wide agitation against the Uddhav Thackeray-led government on Friday while accusing it of “gross failure in curbing the spread of Covid-19”.Reacting to BJP’s call for agitation, Maharashtra NCP president Jayant Patil, who is also the state water resources minister, said that BJP should stay away from politics in times of coronavirus pandemic The BJP leader on Wednesday night said that the agitation would be held under the banner, ‘Mera Aangan, Mera Ranangan’ and appealed to party members and citizens to stand in balconies or courtyards of their houses wearing black clothes or wave black flags or cloth.“The chief minister of Maharashtra has quarantined himself at Matoshree and the state government is being run by bureaucrats,” Chandrakant Patil told reporters in Kolhapur.“It’s time citizens protested against the gross failure of the state government,” said Patil while justifying his call for the day-long agitation.The state BJP chief said that it was expected that the chief minister would lead the state from the front by hitting the ground wearing a mask, gloves and personal protection equipment (PPE), but Uddhav Thackeray has locked himself inside Matoshree.“How can one expect the common man to fight against coronavirus when the CM has shown no courage and is defensive in his approach”, he said.Patil said the party units in each district and city will decide on the time slots for the protest while taking into account the local situation and containment zone norms in each locality.Jayant Patil of the NCP hit back at the BJP on Thursday and said, “Our party never criticised PM Narendra Modi, who was busy attending to US president Donald Trump when coronavirus had already hit India.

China supports 'improvement' of Hong Kong's political system,"Representational photo.

BEIJING: China said on Thursday it supports improving the system and mechanism related to the constitution and basic law of Hong Kong and Macau , in comments likely to stir concern that it could take measures to tighten its grip on Hong Kong.The former European colonies returned to Chinese rule in the late 1990s under a system aimed at preserving their economic systems and ensuring their autonomy, known as ""one country, two systems"".But in Hong Kong in particular, the political system has been thrown into question by student-led pro-democracy protests that went on for months last year and have shown signs of building up again in recent weeks.""We will push for the long-term stability of one country, two systems ... and continue to support the improvement of implementing the systems and mechanisms of the constitution and basic law,"" Wang Yang, the ruling Communist Party's fourth-ranked leader and head of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said in a speech.He did not elaborate. Hong Kong's ""basic law"" is its mini constitution.Wang's remarks came at the opening of a session of the government advisory body that meets in parallel with parliament, which starts its annual session on Friday and will lay out policy targets and initiatives for the year. Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997. The former Portuguese colony of Macau returned two years later.The high degree of autonomy promised to Hong Kong for 50 years under the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement has helped it thrive as a financial centre, while Macau is a major gambling centre.But many people in Hong Kong fear that Beijing is whittling away at its freedoms, worries that fuelled the sometimes violent protests last year. The protests have ebbed since January because of the novel coronavirus outbreak.","Representational photo.

Poll bonds contributed 90% of political parties’ income,"Vijayawada: YSRC has the second highest income — Rs 181 crore — amongst regional political parties for 2018-19 financial year, but nearly Rs 100 crore of its income came from ‘unknown sources’, the latest report by Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) and National Election Watch (NEW) says.

TDP, which is among the top four in accruing income, has shown a funding of Rs 114 crore, including Rs 37.7 crore from unknown sources. This translates to almost 46 per cent funds originating from unknown sources for the two major regional parties in Andhra Pradesh.

Of the Rs 100 crore ‘unknown income’ of YSRC, Rs 99.8 crore was generated through electoral bonds . The same bonds provided a funding of Rs 27.5 crore income from unknown sources to the TDP, while around Rs 10 crore was raised through voluntary contributions. ADR prepared the report based on income tax returns and donation statements filed by the regional political parties with the Election Commission of India.

Unknown sources include donations via electoral bonds, sale of coupons, relief fund, miscellaneous income, voluntary contributions, contributions from meetings etc. As per the report, details of donors of voluntary contributions are not available in public domain.

For its analysis, ADR took into account 52 regional (recognized) parties. But only 26 of them were found to have filed both their annual audit and contribution reports. And of the 26, discrepancies were found in the declarations of TRS, SAD and LJP, which left only 23 parties in the analysis list.

BJD, the ruling party in Odisha, topped the income chart for 2018-19 at Rs 249 crore, of which Rs 213 crore came from unknown sources. The total income of the 23 regional parties stood at Rs 885 crore, out of which funding from unknown sources was Rs 481 crore, including Rs 436 crore through electoral bonds.

Naam Tamizhar Katchi leader Seeman on Saturday addressed the people

COIMBATORE: Communist Party of India (Marxist) central committee member P Sampath and chief coordinator of Naam Tamizhar Katchi Seeman on Saturday addressed the people, who have gathered at masjid ground on Aathupalam Junction in the city, to protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, national registry of citizens (NRC) and the national people’s register (NPR).

It would be wrong to call the countrywide protest ‘Muslim protests’, Sampath said. “The Muslim brethren have been spearheading the protest to safeguard the sovereignty of the country, the Constitution and secularism. The ruling BJP is not concerned about this and is working against the Constitution,” he said.

There are 18 crore Muslims in India and they had fought for the country’s freedom, the CPM leader said. “They are Tipu Sultan’s heirs.”

“While 13 states have passed resolutions against CAA, the Edappadi K Palaniswami-led government in Tamil Nadu has been insisting that the Act would not affect Muslims. It is not Palaniswami’s voice, but the voice of the Sangh Parivar and RSS,” Sampath added.

Seeman, who spoke at the venue later in the day, said the BJP government is distracting people from issues such as privatization of Air India and the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). “The Act is not only against Muslims, but against all Indians,” he said.

BJP &amp; NCP use lockdown to settle political scores,"KOLHAPUR: The in-power NCP and the opposition BJP in Solapur district are engaged in settling a political score by exploiting the nationwide lockdown.

Ram Satpute, the BJP MLA from Malshiras, is currently quarantined at home following a complaint by the NCP. The BJP has now demanded that NCP’s Mohol MLA Mohol Vishwanath Mane too be put into home quarantine for violating the lockdown.

Satpute, was ordered to be in home quarantine last week following a complaint by NCP district general secretary Kiran Sathe . Malshiras block development officer Shama Pawar had ordered Malshiras municipal council to ensure home quarantine of the sitting MLA. BJP sources confirmed that Satpute has been home quarantine for the past few days.

NCP had complained to the district administration that Satpute had returned to Malshiras from Beed and Pune, which is a red zone. The party also pointed out that Satpute conducted a meeting of the government officials after his return to Malshiras. Pawar had then issued an order to put Satpute in home quarantine.

On Wednesday, BJP workers in neighbouring Mohol taluka submitted a memorandum to block development officer, demanding home quarantine for NCP MLA Vishwanath Mane. Mohol BJP president Satish Kale said in a letter that Mane has entered Solapur district from Pune, which is a red zone. Kale has said that Mane had violated lockdown rules and needs to go for home quarantine as per the rules.

Kale also has alleged that Mane had visited two villages after his arrival from Pune.

The Mohol BDO has sent the letter to district collector, seeking an order on the BJP letter.

Love and politics in the Emergency era,"It was for the first time that a film event was held at Lal Bari — the residence of late Chief Minister Siddhartha Shankar Ray — at Beltala Road.

So, why did Kaushik Ganguly choose this historic venue to talk about his upcoming project? “It decided to do it in his house as my next film, Kaberi Antardhan, a romantic thriller, is set in the backdrop of the infamous Emergency of the ’70s in Bengal. At that time, Ray was the chief minister of the state. We are grateful the family allowed us to host this event here,” said Kaushik. Clarifying that there will be no reference of the late CM in the film, he added, “It is just that the love story is set at a time when he was the CM. My film is about the political turmoil of that era.”Prosenjit Chatterjee, who plays the lead in the film, recalled how as a child, he had visited this famous house with his father ( Biswajit Chatterjee ). He said, “I have been to this house and had the privilege to meet and interact with Siddhartha Shankar Ray.”Talking about working with Srabanti , Prosenjit said with a smile, “Srabanti played my daughter’s role in a film years back.

Bhupendrasinh Chudasama’s political future uncertain,"Bhupendrasinh Chudasama. (Photo: Twitter/@imBhupendrasinh)

GANDHINAGAR: Uncertainly looms over the political future of state education and law minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama , after the Gujarat high Court on Tuesday cancelled the 2017 Dholka assembly election result. Chudasama had then won the seat by a little over 300 votes.While it is certain that Chudasama ceases to be a MLA after the HC order, the political leadership can continue with him being a minister in the Vijay Rupani government until a byelection is held for the seat. While the BJP government has thrown its weight behind the beleaguered minister, it stopped short of making an unambiguous statement that Chudasama will continue in government. State government spokesperson and senior BJP leader Nitin Patel, terming the HC verdict “shocking”, said that it will be challenged in a higher court. On the crucial question of whether Bhupendrasinh Chudasama will continue in government, Patel did not offer a direct answer, but said, “The CM, our state president and other leaders will discuss the issue and make a representation to our party’s central leadership and thereafter decide the course of action.”Patel said the HC order was “very sad news for the BJP, as Bhupendrasinhji is our leader since Jan Sangh days and a favourite of our lakhs of workers”. Patel said that Chudasama will challenge the HC order in the Supreme Court and seek an immediate stay on the HC order.Expectedly, Bhupendrasinh Chudasama said he was in touch with his lawyers and will challenge the verdict in the Supreme Court. He did not clarify if he intended to continue as a minister in the government.Congress candidate Ashwin Rathod, who had challenged Chudasama’s election win, said he was happy with the order but his prayer was for the recounting of votes. “If counting of votes was done properly, I would have won. I will file a caveat in the SC,” he said.","Bhupendrasinh Chudasama.

Report on political donations shows AIADMK mum on details,"CHENNAI: Contrasting details on donations from various sources have been submitted by the DMK and the AIADMK, as per the reports presented by the parties to the Election Commission for the year 2018-19. This was revealed as part of the findings of an analysis by Association of Democratic Reforms (ADR) on donations received by regional parties in the country.

Since it was the Lok Sabha election year, parties received large amount of donations in cash, cheques and online transfers. As per the report, among the regional parties in Tamil Nadu, PMK received the maximum donation of Rs 4.19 crore followed by the DMK with Rs 3.5 crore, but the AIADMK has not been forthcoming about any details of donations received. AIADMK official spokesman M Kovai Satyan said, “We are not aware about the accounts submitted to Election Commission. Our coordinator O Panneerselvam, who is also the party's treasurer, or co-coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami will be able to give the reason why no donation details have been mentioned.”

Among the 25 regional parties, PMK recorded the maximum growth, with an increase of 9,106% compared to previous year. The contribution of Rs 1 crore from Sam Paul Education Trust was the largest donation the party, as per the report.

For a large number of donations, regional parties have mentioned ‘online/RTGS/cheque number’ as mode of contribution without providing any further information on bank details.

“National and regional parties should, ideally, lead by example by filing complete and correct statements of donations to the ECI well in time for public scrutiny so as to encourage financial transparency,” said ADR founder Jagdeep Chokkar. The ECI must publicise on its website details of the action taken (if any) against political parties that fail to provide required details (such as name and address) of individuals, companies or entities making donations in cash, he said.

DMK's RS Bharathi moves Madras high court to quash SC/ST case,"RS Bharathi

CHENNAI: Facing a criminal case under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of atrocities) Act, DMK organising secretary R S Bharathi has approached the Madras to quash the FIR.

The FIR was registered for his reported remarks against members of the SC,ST communities, during a speech at a meeting organised by Kalaignar Reading Circle on February 20.

Now, claiming that the complaint was given against him by selectively extracting few lines from the speech, Bharathi contended that only misleading picture of the speech had been highlighted, eliminating the context behind his words.

On Friday, petitioner's counsel R Neelakandan made an urgent mention before Justice N Sathish Kumar seeking an urgent hearing of the plea. To this, the judge said he would take up the plea for hearing on March 24.

According to the petitioner, it is always the sound practice of the courts to read any speech in full and gather the intent of the speaker from the expressions used in the speech as a whole.

""The FIR picks a few words here and there and assigns motives to stray sentences. Police ought to have perused the whole speech without relying on the misleading extracts furnished by the complainant,"" he said.

""The complaint must show prima facie that commission of cognizable offence has occurred and without perusal of the entire speech, police has registered the FIR without coming to such prima facie conclusion about commission of the offence,"" Neelakandan said.

The petitioner may have used infelicitous language or even language that caused offence to some members of the public but in the absence of the specific intent mentioned in the statute, the speech of the petitioner, howsoever disagreeable, cannot be a ground for registration of FIR, he added.

Saga of Congress leaders' arrests continues in Telangana,"Top Congress leaders were taken into police custody or placed under house arrest at various places in Telangan... Read More

HYDERABAD: The saga of arrests of the Congress leaders continued as senior members of the party were taken into police custody or placed under house arrest at various places in Telangana ahead of their visit to the pending irrigation project on Godavari river on Saturday.

AICC secretaries V Hanumanth Rao, S A Sampath Kumar, TPCC working presidents Ponnam Prabhakar and J Vasanth Kumar, CLP leader Bhatti Vikramarka, MLA D Anasuya (Sitakka), former minister Mohd Ali Shabbir were a few arrested. Police started placing many of the Congress members under house arrest since Friday midnight itself.

These arrests came a day after Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president and Nalgonda MP N Uttam Kumar shot off a letter to director general of police mahender reddy to stop harassing the Congress members and allow them to visit irrigation project sites. He also sought to assure the DGP that Congress members would follow physical distance and mask norms.

“We were arrested on June 2 ahead of our protest programme at irrigation project sites on Krishna river, Later, on June 11, we were arrested after giving a call for Chalo Secretariat. The police are not taking action against chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, his ministers and TRS leaders who are freely moving and participating even in congregations in violation of physical distance and mask norms. This is a murder of democracy,” said TPCC president N Uttam Kumar Reddy while registering a strong protest against dictatorial rule of KCR-led TRS government.

AICC secretary V Hanumanth Rao said CM KCR is worried that the failures of his government would be exposed if Congress members are allowed to visit the pending irrigation project sites and protest. “The ruling TRS is not leaving any option for us except going to the Court to get permission to hold a protest. The KCR government is unleashing the police force to crush any voice of dissent against the TRS government,” he said.

Several Congress leaders squatted on the road and in front of police stations insisting that they be allowed to go to the project sites on Godavari river. However, the police took them to police stations where the Congress members continued their protest.

Referring to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao's surprise inspection visit to Kondapochamma Sagar project on Friday evening, TPCC president N Uttam Kumar Reddy said whie KCR himself goes to irrigation project sites when ever he wants, the Congress members are now allowed despite informing the police about the programme in advance. ""Telangana police is repeatedly violating the privileges of Congress MPs, MLAs and MLCs and warned that they would take up the issue with the presiding officer of the parliament, council and assembly,"" Uttam said.

CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday said the Congress stood a good chance of returning to power for a second term in Punjab in the absence of a strong opposition and, by doing so, taking the state's progress to the next level.

During an interaction at a conclave to mark the completion of three years of his government, Capt Amarinder said the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) had lost ground, while the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was in disarray in the state. ""The Akalis do not even have leadership at the moment, as the Badals have never allowed strong leadership to emerge. As for AAP, there was a lot of hype even during the 2017 polls, but it failed to translate it into a victory,"" he said.

If the Congress returns to power, he said, the next seven years will see Punjab being restored to its previous glory of being India's No. 1 state.

Amarinder reiterated he was geared up to contest the next assembly elections. ""I had thought that five years would be enough to revive the state's fortunes, but the situation had been so bad that the government needs more time,"" he said. While finances had improved, the state government was still going through a financial crunch and needed to spend judiciously said Amarinder.

Residents slam corporation for political posts on social media,"Trichy: The social media accounts of Trichy Corporation, which were revived recently after a two-month lull, have been criticised by residents for not sharing awareness messages and statistics on Covid-19 as done by other civic bodies. The corporation had shared a video of a state minister distributing welfare kits on Facebook and Twitter, which did not go well with the public. They wanted the civic body to be responsible in sharing Covid-19 updates.Residents were demanding that the social media handles are activated so that live updates about containment zones will be known to the public. On May 6, the civic body reactivated the accounts.

Immediately, a video of Trichy East MLA and tourism minister Vellamandi Natarajan distributing welfare aid to people was shared. This attracted backlash from the public with many criticising the corporation for sharing political posts.

“It is unprofessional for a civic body to share such videos. It can share info on Covid-19 hotspots and preventive measures taken,” I Prasanna, a resident of Subramaniapuram said.

While many corporation staff are unaware of the official social media handles, officials assured that information will be shared.

Punjab: Sacrilege cases in legal tangle as government fights CBI over probe,"A 2019 protest for action in the cases

Probe status

Police firing cases

CHANDIGARH: One of the main reasons for the SAD-BJP government tasting its worst-ever defeat in the 2017 Punjab assembly polls was sacrilege incidents and police firing at Sikh protesters. People elected the Congress as it promised to deliver justice in these infamous incidents of desecration of Guru Granth Sahib and subsequent police firing incidents of October 2015 in Faridkot district which led to the death of two Sikh protesters.As the Congress completes three years in power, people’s anger against the SAD-BJP alliance is turning towards the incumbent party as they still await justice. This despite the fact that Congress made sacrilege and police firing cases at Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan major poll planks in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls too.Then Congress national president Rahul Gandhi even addressed a rally at Bargari, the epicentre of sacrilege protests. Even chief minister Amarinder Singh announced in that rally to build a memorial for those killed and injured in the firing. The memorial is yet to see the light of day.SAD is now trying to turn the tables on Congress for not bringing perpetrators to book, and incumbent party MLAs have also started questioning the government. Congress Jalandhar Cantt MLA Pargat Singh took on his own government during the recent budget session of the assembly, saying party functionaries felt embarrassed when people asked them why their government had not been able to ensure trial in the five-year-old cases.An FIR was registered on June 2, 2015, for the theft of Guru Granth Sahib from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala gudwara, second FIR was registered on September 25, 2015, for handwritten posters and the third on October 12, 2015, over torn pages of Guru Granth Sahib being found in Bargari village. These FIRs, registered at Bajakhana police station, were initially handed over to CBI by the previous SAD-BJP government in November 2015.In April 2017, the Congress government formed Justice Ranjit Singh inquiry commission to probe the incidents. Later, after a resolution passed by the state assembly, the Punjab government issued a notification on September 6, 2018, withdrawing the probe from CBI.But, CBI continued with the probe and filed a closure report in the special CBI court in Mohali on July 4, 2019. The Punjab and Haryana high court upheld the state’s right to take the probe back. Even Supreme Court (SC), on February 20, rejected CBI’s plea and allowed Punjab Police SIT to probe sacrilege cases too. Earlier this month, CBI informed the Mohali trial court it was going to seek a review of SC’s decision.Police had on October 14, 2015, opened fire on protesters at Behbal Kalan, in which two Sikh men — Sarawan village’s Gurjit Singh and Niamia Wala village’s Krishan Bhagwan Singh — died. Police also fired in Kotkapura, injuring many protesters. Both cases are pending before the Faridkot district and sessions court for framing of charges.Punjab Police SIT headed by special DGP Prabodh Kumar (bureau of investigation director) has presented one challan in the Behbal Kalan case in the Faridkot district court. It would present another challan in this case. It has presented three challans in trial court in the Kotkapura case and would present one more soon.","A 2019 protest for action in the casesProbe statusPolice firing casesCHANDIGARH: One of the main reasons for the SAD-BJP government tasting its worst-ever defeat in the 2017 Punjab assembly polls was sacrilege incidents and police firing at Sikh protesters.

Political murder convict jumps parole,"Kannur: Koothuparamba police have strengthened probe after a convicted prisoner in a murder case went absconding after jumping parole. Police started the investigation after CPM worker Anneri Vipin (35), who along with his father and eight others was awarded life imprisonment in the murder of BJP worker K Pramod in August 2007, failed to report at the central prison here on the completion of his parole on March 16.

According to police, the probe was initiated after his wife Shruthilaya complained that Vipin left home on March 16 and his whereabouts are not known. Though the family thought he had gone back to jail on completion of parole, later, they came to know that he did not reach the jail. The prison authorities then filed a police complaint.

Police sources said that Vipin had apparently taken up some quarrel with his wife, who is working as a nurse abroad and then left home. Though his whereabouts are unknown, the indication is that he left for Mumbai or nearby area. His mobile phone has been switched off since.

On April 4, 2018, the Thalassery additional sessions court awarded life imprisonment to Vipin, his father Anneri Pavithran and eight others in the murder case. After he was awarded jail term, Vipin went on parole within one year and got married. He had availed around 200 days of parole using various means after he was imprisoned, said officials.

Jail authorities said since it is a parole break case, a warrant would be issued. They would also alert police in other states where he is likely to go.

Rajinikanth: K Kamaraj look-alikes for Rajinikanth's campaign,"This story is from March 16, 2020

Rajinikanth

CHENNAI: 'Tandoras' (tomtoms), LED screen-fitted vehicles and artists dressed like former Congress leader and chief minister K Kamaraj will help take forward actor Rajinikanth 's call for political resurgence in Tamil Nadu as functionaries of his Makkalm Mandram spearhead the campaign for 'TN political change - Now or Never'.

RMM functionaries in Krishnagiri, Vellore and neighbouring districts are preparing to launch the campaign to popuralise the actor's ideas to bring about 'a political and regime change'.

Rajinikanth, while addressing journalists last Thursday, made a dramatic disclosure about his reluctance to aspire for the chief minister's post and instead proposed three strategies to bring about change in the political system and governance to ensure a corruption-free government.

The RMM functionaries are planning different kinds of campaigns, from 'Thinnai Pracharam' (one-on-one interactions at people's doorstep) to social media, to cobble together support for the actor's policies. RMM's booth-level committees are expected to play a key role in the campaign.

Rajinikanth's fans have been disheartened about his unwillingness to be in the CM race, but his ""selfless political policies"" were well received, RMM's Vellore integrated district secretary Sholinghur N Ravi told TOI. ""We are planning to use LED fitted vehicles to play our Thalaivar's speech in public places. We will work hard for a political resurgence. The campaign will continue for more than a month,"" he said. The RMM cadres have readied five LED screen-fitted vehicles, besides more than 50,000 pamphlets to distribute to the public. They would meet people at the weekly village shandies, worship and other public places.

RMM functionaries in other districts have launched similar innovative campaigns to reach out to people. While the Trichy unit of the mandram is planning to take up 'Thinnai Pracharam', the Madurai unit is all set for a 'tandora' (tomtom) campaign with artists dressed like former chief minister K Kamaraj. Several fans along with their family members have been meeting people in their vicinity and travelling in buses to spread Rajinikanth's message. ""We will focus on lower economic group and women, in particular, to garner support,"" said Trichy RMM executive committee member Palakkarai K Sakthithivel. He added that they would carry out the campaign as a prelude to the forthcoming election campaigns. RMM Krishnagiri district secretary K V S Srinivasan said the actor's speech will be played in every nook and cranny of the district to drum up support.

The RMM's Chennai North wing would begin the campaign by organising a public meeting at Maha Kavi Bharathi Nagar. ""We will explain the selfless policies of our Thalaivar. At the end of the public meeting, there will be a question and answer session with the public to clear their doubts,"" said a functionary.

Tamil Nadu CM Edappadi K Palaniswami accuses DMK chief M K Stalin of fearmongering,"This story is from March 14, 2020

Edappadi K Palaniswami

CHENNAI: Countering the charge that his government was scared of the Centre for not passing a resolution in the state assembly against the updation of national population register, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Friday said DMK chief M K Stalin with trying to create fear in the minds of people, especially the minorities. The government rejected the demand of the DMK and its allies, Congress and IUML, that a resolution be passed on the announcement made by revenue minister R B Udayakumar at a media interaction on Thursday that the state had put on hold the NPR exercise for seeking clarification from the Centre on three new questions in the form. ""You have been saying that our government is scared of the Centre, as it (cabinet) would land in prison. That would never happen. (Entha kalaathilum athu nadakkave nadakkathu),"" he said, recalling the cases faced by the former DMK ministers. The debate began when DMK leader S Durai Murugan raised the breach of privilege issue against Udayakumar for addressing the media when assembly was in session.

Refuting the charge, Palaniswami said the minister had only reiterated what was said earlier in the assembly. NPR is conducted in accordance with the Citizenship Amendment Act 2003. The amendment was made when the DMK was in power at the Centre (in alliance with the BJP). The state government has sought clarification from the Centre as there were apprehensions among Muslims, he said. ""There were incidents in Delhi and there was trouble. But, Tamil Nadu has remained peaceful and people live in harmony,"" the CM said, urging the opposition to ensure peace in the state. Udayakumar said he spoke to reporters to defuse the tension in the wake of the opposition leader's statements that documents were required for NPR, which was not the case. There was loud thumping of desks in the opposition benches when the DMK chief demanded that the government come forward to pass a resolution on the minister's announcement. Udayakumar demanded to know how a resolution could be passed by the state legislature against a legislation passed by the Parliament. ""Even Union home minister Amit Shah had clarified in Parliament yesterday that there was no need for documents for NPR. We cannot be mere spectators when you cause tension among minorities by making baseless statements,"" the minister said. Durai Murugan demanded to know why the minister did not make the statement about NPR being put on hold on the floor of assembly.

PATNA: All three NDA candidates for Rajya Sabha, including deputy chairman of the Upper House of Parliament Harivansh Narayan Singh, filed their nomination papers in the state assembly on Friday.

Senior NDA functionaries, including CM Nitish Kumar, deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, JD(U) state president Bashishtha Narayan Singh and state BJP president Dr Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal, accompanied them in the chamber of the state assembly secretary Bateshwar Nath Pandey.

While Harivansh is the nominee of the JD(U), the two other NDA candidates are Ram Nath Thakur from the JD(U) and Vivek Thakur from the BJP. Several senior ministers, including Bijendra Prasad Yadav, Shrawan Kumar, Nand Kishore Yadav and Mangal Pandey were also present on the occasion.

With two RJD nominees Prem Chand Gupta and Amrendra Dhari Singh having already filed their nomination papers on Thursday, there are altogether five candidates to fill the equal number of seats that would fall vacant next month. Since no sixth candidate is in race, all five candidates looked set to get elected unopposed.

While the scrutiny of papers will be done on Monday, the five candidates would be deemed as elected unopposed on March 18, the last day of withdrawal of nomination papers. Otherwise, the election date was due on March 26.

“I feel grateful to CM Nitish Kumar for selecting a common man and sending him to the Rajya Sabha,” Harivansh said. It would be his second term in the Rajya Sabha.

“The CM has been paying attention to improving the social and economic reality of the dalits, socially backward sections and economically deprived groups. He has become their voice,” Ram Nath said.

Vivek said the BJP has always been a party of committed workers and honoured them. He also thanked the party’s central and state leadership for selecting him for the Rajya Sabha. Later, he was given a rousing welcome at the party’s state headquarters. “The mood of the party workers was upbeat,” state BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand said.

PATNA: While Loktantrik Janta Dal (LJD) chief Sharad Yadav on Friday refused to comment on RJD’s nomination for the Rajya Sabha, his party state vice-president Binu Yadav criticized RJD chief Lalu Prasad for betraying Sharad and even asked people not to vote for the party.

“He (Lalu) had betrayed an old socialist leader. It was Sharad Yadav who had parted ways with JD (U) for the sake of mandate of 11 crore people of Bihar and joined hands with Lalu Prasad. Now when time has come to send him to Rajya Sabha, Lalu sold the ticket to a rich businessman,” said Binu.

Playing the caste card, Binu said that the entire Yadav community had been cheated. “It is now clear that neither the Yadavs nor Muslims are with the RJD. Lalu actually believes in use and throw policy and people need to be cautious. Now, the people of Bihar will decide whether to caste vote in favour of such leaders or not?” Binu said. He further said his party will be contesting on all the 243 seats in the upcoming state assembly election.

Talking to an electronic media channel earlier, Sharad said he will be soon coming to Bihar and hold talks with his alliance partners and discuss the ‘sehat’ (health) of Mahagatbandhan.

Sharad had already said that he was not interested in state politics and will be doing politics from the Centre.

Why China's maneuvers in Nepal politics worry India,"NEW DELHI: China’s strategy in Nepal hinges on an important fact — the unity among the different factions of the Nepal Communist party. But even to China watchers, the sight of Hou Yanqi, China’s ambassador to Nepal conducting a series of meetings with the main faction leaders of the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) — Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ and Madhav Nepal (UML) — to work out a compromise that would allow KP Sharma Oli to continue as PM for the full 5-year term was surprising, and to many, worrying.

Official and political sources in India say they have been following the events in the Himalayan state with concern, as allegations of China micro-managing Nepal’s normally fractious politics abound. But the government does not want to make this a public battle for influence in Nepal for two reasons, largely because all the players of the current political drama have separately reached out to the Indian system, and that India reckons China will be the worse for wear getting in the mud of the never-ending chaos of Nepali domestic politics.

Hou Yanqi’s last minute dash among the NCP leaders was preceded, even more strangely, by a phone conversation between Chinese President Xi Jinping and the Nepal President Bidya Bhandari . It’s unusual for the Chinese President to initiate a call of this nature, particularly with the President, who’s not the political head of the country. The upshot of this level of micro diplomacy was to avert a full-fledged political crisis — Prachanda, Madhav Nepal, Bamdev Gautam and Jhala Nath Khanal all fell in line to keep Oli in power. The deal keeps Prachanda as head of the party, Gautam as a member of parliament silencing the main opposition.

Bishnu Rijal of the NCP’s international department was quoted as saying, ""We should see these meetings in three contexts. One, China’s diplomatic outreach after the Covid-19 outbreak; second, China’s medical and other assistance to Nepal; and third, China’s interest in the emerging political situation in our party."" He also told journalists that China was interested in the unity of the Nepal Communist Party. Chinese investments in Nepal are not doing too well, diluting the potential gains from Xi’s visit to Kathmandu last October after the Mamallapuram summit. Between Covid pandemic and the US pushing its Millennium Cooperation programme in Nepal, even BRI is coming under pressure.

India’s interests remain in the formation of a stronger democratic political front, which should ideally be helmed by the Nepali Congress. Between their indifferent parliamentary strength and a party opposition to Sher Bahadur Deuba as leader, the NC is sort of hobbled at the moment when they could have gained at the Communists’ expense.

Oli’s position had become wobbly because of two ordinances he decided to promulgate — amending the Constitutional Council (Duties, Functions and Procedures) Act and to amend the Political Party Act — came under extreme criticism and opposition to the extent that they were hurriedly withdrawn.

But in the interim, two political parties with a strong presence in the Madhes joined hands — Samajbadi Party and Rashtriya Janata Party, third and fourth largest parties in Parliament merged to form the Janata Samajbadi Party, with Baburam Bhattarai as a potential leader. In a sense, it shows a coming together of democratic political forces outside the NC. The Mashes-strong party would have a more positive approach to India. And, it could be the glue for other democratic parties to form a credible opposition to the NCP in future. As a matter of fact, it was this merger that heaped criticism on Oli and made his position tenuous.

Indian Nepal watchers believe the ""compromise"" hammered out by the Chinese may come under pressure anyway from the inherent divisions among the Communist leadership of the NCP — the widely divergent backgrounds of the maoists and UML, as well as the personal ambitions of all their factional leaders may make it difficult to sustain the current peace. Oli’s own hell-for-leather politics will keep him on top for the time being — a remarkable feat given his failing health.

For the moment, Indian observers are watching the Chinese actions closely — ""we are concerned, but we need to watch more closely,"" they said.

Delhi: AAP government may move against NPR today,"This story is from March 13, 2020

NEW DELHI: Describing it as a step towards National Register of Citizens (NRC), the AAP government may bring a resolution against the National Population Register (NPR) in the day-long special Delhi assembly session on March 13.

Sources said the legislators may argue that the current atmosphere in Delhi — especially in the wake of communal riots in northeast and protests at several other areas — was not favourable for the update of NPR, which is slated to begin from April 1, and may demand its suspension. The legislators may also demand that the NPR questionnaire may be reverted to 2010 format, which did not require an individual to share additional information such as the place of birth of their parents.

“There is a general sense that in this atmosphere there was a need to take a stand to allay the general fear of the minorities,” said a legislator requesting anonymity.

The NPR, which began in 2010 and updated in 2015, is a list of “usual residents” of the country, which means those who have been residing in a local area for at least last six months or intend to stay in a particular location for the next six months.

Delhi has witnessed massive protests against the amended citizenship act and people fear that NPR may be the first step towards bringing nationwide NRC.

The Delhi assembly is also likely to have a detailed discussion on CAA and NRC apart from the coronavirus scare. The AAP had voted against the citizenship law amendments in both houses of the Parliament. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had stressed that entire country should “reject” the law, arguing that it will affect “both Hindus and Muslims” in equal measure.

Prem Chand Gupta (centre) and Amrendra Dhari Singh (left) with RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav after filing t... Read More

PATNA: The Lalu Prasad-led RJD sprung a surprise on Thursday by fielding Amrendra Dhari Singh, an entrepreneur hailing from Dulhin Bazar in rural Patna, for the upcoming biennial election for Rajya Sabha.

Amrendra, from bhumihar caste, is a political greenhorn even though RJD state president Jagdanand Singh told reporters at the party headquarters here that he is a social worker and has been associated with the party from a while.

His name was announced along with Lalu’s close aide Prem Chand Gupta, who is a sitting member of the Upper House. “Prem Chand Gupta and Amrendra Dhari Singh have been selected by RJD for Rajya Sabha nomination. Amrendra Dhari has been a social worker and an eminent personality. He is a well-educated and learned person, who we believe, will be able to aptly represent the party in the Upper House,” Jagdanand said.

A 50-year-old bachelor, Amrendra Dhari is in the business of fertilisers and real estate. RJD insiders claimed that he is the grandson of late Jangdhari Singh, who was a well-known Bhumihar landlord of his time.

Many RJD MLAs claimed they don’t know much about Amrendra Dhari. Muneshwar Chaudhary, an RJD MLA, who was a proposer in the nomination filing process at the legislative assembly, told reporters that he came after being called by the party.

“Big leaders of the party must be aware of him. Whatever will be decided by the top leaders of our party- Lalu Ji and Tejashwi Ji will be accepted by us and we will be the voter for that person,” Chaudhary said.

Several other MLAs also cited lack of knowledge about Amrendra Dhari and claimed that they were told over phone to come for the nomination process and they were adhering to the instructions.

Political observers claimed that RJD has taken another step towards wooing the forward castes ahead of the assembly elections by nominating Amrendra Dhari. The apparent bid to attract forward caste by RJD started with the appointment of Jagdanand Singh as the state unit president last year.

Jagdanand, too, claimed that selection of Amrendra dhari shows representation of all sections of society in RJD. “RJD follows the Sarv-Samaj (entire society) policy and we are ensuing that all section of the society is suitably represented. It will be seen in the legislative council as well as upcoming assembly election as well,” he said.

Tejashwi also told reporters that the candidature of Prem Chand Gupta— a Vaishya — and Amrendra, a Bhumihar, “is a befitting reply to those who accuse RJD of confining itself to Muslim- Yadav (MY) combine”.

","His name was announced along with Lalu’s close aide Prem Chand Gupta, who is a sitting member of the Upper House.

It is rare to witness the biggest political names of the country come together under one roof unless it's a political event.

I had no time. Whoever I met at the Parliament today, I requested them to come in the evening. Rajnath. I was running from pillar to post but people came on their own and they are all dear friends.""

Michael Jordan defends 'selfish' reluctance on politics,"(Getty Images)

LOS ANGELES: Michael Jordan has defended his infamous reluctance to be drawn into taking political sides during his NBA career, saying he never viewed himself as an activist.

In comments made on the latest episode of the hit documentary series ""The Last Dance"" on ESPN, Jordan addressed his oft-quoted quip that he had steered clear of politics because ""Republicans buy sneakers, too.""

Jordan said the remark, which came during the 1990 US Senate race in North Carolina between Republican Jesse Helms and Democrat challenger Harvey Gantt , had been a flippant comment made as a joke.

Helms was a controversial figure who had been accused of racism throughout his career, a staunch opponent of the 1964 Civil Rights Act who also opposed the establishment of Martin Luther King day as a US federal holiday.

""I don't think that statement needs to be corrected because I said it in jest on a bus with Horace Grant and Scottie Pippen,"" Jordan said.

""It was thrown off the cuff. My mother asked to do a PSA (public service announcement) for Harvey Gantt, and I said, 'Look, Mom, I'm not speaking out of pocket about someone that I don't know. But I will send a contribution to support him.' Which is what I did.""

Jordan added that he never saw himself as an activist athlete in the vein of former heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali .

""I do commend Muhammad Ali for standing up for what he believed in,"" Jordan said. ""But I never thought of myself as an activist. I thought of myself as a basketball player.""

Jordan conceded that his apolitical stance might be viewed as selfish in some quarters.

""I wasn't a politician when I was playing my sport. I was focused on my craft,"" Jordan said. ""Was that selfish? Probably. But that was my energy. That's where my energy was.""

In the same documentary, former US President Barack Obama said he believed Jordan could have spoken out more.

""I'll be honest, when it was reported that Michael said, 'Republicans buy sneakers, too' -- for somebody who was at that time preparing for a career in civil rights law and knowing what Jesse Helms stood for, you would've wanted to see Michael push harder on that,"" Obama said.

Jordan, now 57, insisted he had no regrets, saying he had sought to set an example by his achievements as an athlete.

""It's never going to be enough for everybody, and I know that,"" he said. ""Because everybody has a preconceived idea for what I should do and what I shouldn't do.

""The way I go about my life is I set examples. If it inspires you? Great, I will continue to do that. If it doesn't? Then maybe I'm not the person you should be following.""

Gujarat Congress moves MLAs to hotels after 3 resignations,"Congress MLAs arrive at Neel City resort in Rajkot on Saturday

AHMEDABAD: Social distancing might be the norm world over during Covid-19 pandemic but a desperate Gujarat Congress has packed its flock of 65 MLAs in three resorts and hotels to keep them together ahead of crucial Rajya Sabha polls.

With eight Congress MLAs resigning ever since RS polls were announced - of these three namely Akshay Patel (Karjan), Jitu Chaudhary (Kaprada) and Brijesh Merja (Morbi) resigned in past two days -- the beleaguered party, yet again, packed off its remaining 65 MLAs to three resorts near Ambaji, Rajkot and Vadodara, on Saturday.

Congress leaders confirmed that the 65 MLAs have been housed at Neel City Resort in Rajkot, at Wild Winds Resort in neighbouring Congress-ruled Rajasthan and at Aries Riverside Farmhouse located near Vadodara. Sources in the party said that about 40 MLAs have been housed at Neel City in Rajkot, the remaining have been lodged at the two other locations. Neel City resort is owned by Congress leader Indranil Rajyaguru, who contested against CM Vijay Rupani in the 2017 assembly polls.

2 more likely to resign

The move came amid sources insisting on a strong possibility that two more Congress MLAs, who are disgruntled with the leadership, could tender their resignations before the June 19 RS polls.

Congress spokesperson Jayrajsinh Parmar said that there is no restriction of movement of MLAs out of the resorts, but the step has been taken to ensure that the BJP does not use coercive means to poach Congress MLAs. “There will not be any more defections now. The MLAs will go through training sessions on how the RS election is held and how they will be supposed to cast their votes,” he said.

In Covid pandemic, this is truly a desperate measure as Congress MLAs were seen standing in close proximity of each other, many not even wearing masks.

State BJP president Jitu Vaghani said the Congress’ move to shift its MLAs to safe locations was an internal matter of the party. “Going by the resignations, it is clear that not just the people of Gujarat, but even elected MLAs have lost confidence in the leadership. The Congress does not have the numbers to get two candidates elected, while the BJP is comfortably placed to ensure victory of all its three candidates,” Vaghani said. This is the third time in less than three years and the second time in three months that the Congress has had to move its Gujarat legislators to safe locations in a bid to prevent defections. While the party airlifted its MLAs to a resort in Karnataka before the 2017 Rajya Sabha election which senior party leader Ahmed Patel won by a whisker, earlier this year, in March, the Congress flew its MLAs to Rajasthan in the wake of five MLAs resigning.

MP Latest News: Back in focus in political turmoil; Jyotiraditya Scindia family’s BJP connections,"This story is from March 10, 2020

Jyotiraditya Scindia

BHOPAL: Will Jyotiraditya Scindia fulfil his grandmother Vijayaraje Scindia’s dream of the family’s return to BJP — the party she had founded and nurtured along with members of Jana Sangh?

Vijayaraje, from the family that once ruled Gwalior, joined electoral politics in 1957 as a Congress member and won Guna Lok Sabha seat, but switched to Jana Sangh in 1967. She played a significant role in nurturing the saffron citadel in Gwalior region and in 1971, Jana Sangh defied the Indira Gandhi-wave and won three seats — Vijayaraje from Bhind, Atal Bihari Vajpayee from Gwalior and Vijayaraje’s son Madhavrao Scindia from Guna.

The Scindia family plunged headlong into state politics and Madhavrao Scindia became a Lok Sabha member at the age of 26. But the saffron love didn’t last long for him, and he chose to part ways with Jana Sangh and his mother after Emergency in 1977.

In the 1980 elections, he switched allegiance to Congress and won from Guna a third time, and served as Union minister in the Congress government. Madhavrao’s son Jyotiraditya Scindia carried on with his legacy.

In the meantime, Vijayaraje’s daughters Vasundhara Raje and Yashodhara Raje also entered politics. In 1984, Vasundhara Raje joined as a member of the BJP national executive. She was also elected to the 8th Rajasthan assembly from Dholpur. Vasundhara’s son Dushyant is a BJP MP from Jhalawar constituency in Rajasthan.

Yashodhara moved to New Orleans, USA, in 1977 after marrying Sidharth Bhansali, a cardiologist. She has three children, none of who joined politics. Yashodhara returned to India in 1994 and went into formal politics by contesting the MP assembly election in 1998 as a BJP member. A five-time MLA, she was a minister in the erstwhile Shivraj Singh Chouhan government.

Jyotiraditya chose to remain in Congress. After his father’s death in a plane crash in 2001, Guna Lok Sabha constituency fell vacant. Jyotiraditya contested the bypoll in 2002 and won by a record margin of 4.5 lakh votes. Jyotiraditya won the next three LS polls from Guna but suffered a shock defeat in 2019 at the hands of his long-time aide Krishna Pal Singh Yadav.

It was a double blow to Jyotiraditya, having lost out in the race for chief ministership only six months earlier. Despite playing a significant role in Congress’s victory in the 2018 assembly polls, Jyotiraditya could get the support of only 23 MLAs. The then AICC chief Rahul Gandhi picked Kamal Nath for his experience, and indicated that Scindia’s time would come. After the Lok Sabha defeat, Jyotiraditya felt sidelined by the state Congress leadership although six MLAs from his faction were made ministers in the Kamal Nath cabinet.

In January 2019, Scindia sparked a buzz by calling on former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan one evening. Both leaders dismissed speculation and called it a “courtesy meet”. In September 2019, rumours went around that he could switch to BJP. Scindia clarified that he has no intention of leaving Congress and dubbed the reports as “rumour-mongering by vested interests”. Then, in November, he dropped all references to his official posts in Congress from his twitter profile. He played it down, saying he had changed the profile a month earlier, and chose to identify himself as a “public servant and cricket enthusiast”.

As of March 9, when 17 MLAs from his faction went missing, his Twitter profile said the same.

Suspense prevails on political ties,"This story is from February 4, 2020

Aurangabad: As the AMC election campaigns gain pace, rumours of possible political alliances have intensified. With reservation allocated to 115 wards, both the BJP and the Sena on Monday expressed readiness to contest the elections independently.

The Sena-BJP relationship weakened within the AMC after the former cut ties to form a government with Congress and NCP. The relationship ended in December when Vijay Autade quit as deputy mayor over a proposal to felicitate Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray.

The AMC election — set to be held in April — is likely to see intense battles between the Sena and the BJP.

When asked how the Sena plans to face the polls alone, mayor Nandkumar Ghodele said the party is now used to winning. “Even when it was part of the alliance, Sena had to fight on its own capacity,” he said. However, he did not confirm whether Sena will go to polls in alliance with the NCP or the Congress.

The BJP also stayed mum on rumours of a possible alliance. Party’s group leader in AMC and former deputy mayor Pramod Rathod said ward reservation has ensured justice for all.

MIM corporator and former group leader Naser Siddiqui said his party will field candidates for 60 seats and will likely win 40.

Rajini no MGR to succeed in politics: Cong,"This story is from March 13, 2020

Thanjavur: Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K S Alagiri has said that actor Rajinikanth is not M G Ramachandran to succeed in politics. Commenting on the actor’s announcement about launching a party, Alagiri said he doesn’t share the expectations of Rajini fans that he would come into active politics. “His fans still believe that Rajinikanth will launch a party and subsequently plunge into electoral politics in the forthcoming assembly elections in the state. But I am not convinced that he will do that,” he added.

Replying to questions at Thirupananthal near Kumbakonam after attending a marriage here on Thursday, Alagiri said Rajnikanth is a good actor but not M G Ramachandran. So, his efforts will not succeed. However, the Congress would not oppose him if he would like to enter politics, he added. On the CAA, NRC and NPR, the Congress president promised to protect minorities. “We can assure that the Congress party and its allied secular parties are the only hope of minorities in the country. As long as Congress is there, nobody will send even a single minority out of the country. Both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah are just making threats”, he added.

Political parties start preparationsfor election,"This story is from March 13, 2020

Jaipur: Dates for elections to six municipal corporations in the state have been announced and preparations have begun in both the political parties for the municipal body elections announced on Thursday.

While the Congress is still in the planning stage, the BJP has already appointed its workers in the city to supervise the municipal wards and shortlisted probable candidates who are active in their respective areas. As per the information provided by the BJP members, they have divided Jaipur in different levels.

BJP sources said that as per the 10 state assembly areas, Jaipur has been divided into 33 mandals. In every state assembly area, there can be five to three mandals and in each mandal, there can be 4 to 6 wards. At the top level, Vidhan Sabha Prerak has been appointed by the party followed by Mandal Prerak under him. The work of the Mandal Prerak is to get information about caste equation, influential voters and powerful families of the ward.

One BJP member, who didn’t want to be named said, “Everything has been planned and the work has been divided. Unofficially, we have been asked to prepare a list of influential people in the ward who can be given tickets, to figure out the Congress vote bank in the ward and to chalk out strategies to break their vote bank. A voters’ list will be prepared for the number of people residing outside the district or ward.” People have already started approaching the district heads of political parties to secure a ticket for the upcoming elections.

Both the parties are, however, certain that the OBC women mayors in both the corporations will be chosen from the already active members in their women’s wing. “There are no active women OBC members in the city but we are trying to give tickets to women members active in the party in our women’s wing. It will make much sense. Within a few days, it will be clear,” said one Congress member.

"Punjab: Ex-MP Paramjit Kaur Gulshan quits SAD for Dhindsas, says want to free SGPC of Badals' control","This story is from March 8, 2020

Paramjit Kaur Gulshan (second from left, sitting) with Sukhdev Dhindsa

BATHINDA: Two-time ex-MP Paramjit Kaur Gulshan quit the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Saturday to join expelled party leaders Rajya Sabha MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and his MLA son, Parminder Singh Dhindsa.

Apart from Gulshan, SAD functionary Bhola Singh Gilpatti, Bathinda zila parishad ex-chairperson Rajwinder Kaur and Istri Akali Dal district-level activist Gurminderpal Kaur too joined Dhindsas in a function at Bathinda. Gulshan contested on a SAD ticket from Bathinda parliamentary constituency in 2004 and from Faridkot in 2009, and won. She lost in 2014 from Faridkot and was denied the party ticket in 2019.

At the function, Dhindsa took on the Badal family, saying that the Akali Dal headed by Badals was not the real Akali Dal, but it was Akali Dal (Badal). He said Akali leaders angry with the Badals were aiming to snatch control of Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee(SGPC) from the family. he said even SAD (1920) and ex-MLA Harinder Singh Phoolka had joined hands to free the SGPC of Badals.

Dhindsa gave a clarion call to everyone, except Congress and SAD (Badal), to join them for SGPC elections. ""Till Parkash Singh Badal was at the helm of affairs, he was acceptable to all as he used to listen to us. But, after he took over the reins of the party, Sukhbir Badal started controlling it with remote and turned into a dictator. He stopped listening. It is because of him that many leaders are deserting SAD and more leaders will join,"" he said.

In response to Badals accusing him of backstabbing the party despite being awarded by the party, Dhindsa said it was not the Badals, but his seniority and dedication to the party which got him positions. ""Instead, it was the party which made Badal a chief minister five times,"" he said.

Gulshan said there was no place in the party for members of scheduled castes.

"Goa zilla panchayat elections: After 32 back out, 203 remain in fray","This story is from March 8, 2020

Representative image

PANAJI: With the process to withdraw nominations complete and 32 candidates backing out, 203 candidates remain in the running for the zilla panchayat elections which will be held on March 22. BJP is contesting the elections in 41 seats while Congress is fielding candidates in 38 seats— 21 in North Goa and 17 in South Goa.

Learning from its past experiences, Congress seems to have taken precautions against losing their candidates to the BJP. State party president Girish Chodankar said, “There is a lot of pressure on our candidates; we had to take some of them away and keep them with us for protection.”

MGP, which has an informal pact with the Congress, will fight the elections in 17 seats. AAP and NCP have put up candidates in 21 and 6 constituencies, respectively. Except for MGP’s Arambol candidate, all the other candidates who pulled out were independent candidates.

Meanwhile, in a boost for BJP, the saffron party managed to convince four of its rebel members who were contesting the ZP elections as independents, to withdraw their candidature.

Independent candidates mainly from Anjuna, Siolim, Penha de Franca, Socorro and Colvale constituencies have withdrawn their nominations, quite a few of them women. As per information obtained from the returning officers, in Anjuna constituency, independent candidate Lata Vishwajeet Parab has withdrawn her nomination, in Siolim, Pallavi Pradeep Dhabolkar has backed out.

Rakhi Salgaonkar and Roshani Sharachandra Naik have withdrawn their nominations in Penha de Franca . In Socorro, Gauri Sachin Volvoikar has withdrawn her nomination.

Chodankar said that in the elections, 80% of Goa’s voting population will vote and voice their sentiments regarding the BJP government’s functioning.

There were no withdrawal of nominations in four constituencies namely Calangute, Reis Magos, Aldona and Sirsaim.

As many as 10 candidates are in the fray for the zilla panchayat election in the Sattari taluka, which comprises three constituencies. Seventeen will contest from Bicholim taluka.

AAP has constituted a 25-member committee headed by Valmiki Naik to galvanise the party in each of the 1,640 booths in the state.

“Over the next two years, the party has dedicated itself to contest the next assembly elections in 2022 and as part of that, we are announcing a three-month-long party rebuilding exercise, ‘Mission Nirman’, that will start after the ZP elections,” said state in-charge and AAP Delhi MLA Atishi Marlena.

The exercise will be executed in three phases. In the first phase, volunteer meetings will be carried out in each taluka. In the second phase, from April 1 to 15, the committee will conduct volunteer meetings in all the 40 assembly constituencies.

“From April 15 to May 15, meetings will be carried out in all the 1,640 booths that exist across Goa. After May 15, there will be a booth-level karyakarta sammelan where two volunteers from every booth will be picked to attend the sammelan,” said the newly-elected MLA.

AAP also criticised the BJP for not doing enough in the Supreme Court to highlight Goa’s concerns about water being diverted from the Mhadei river basin. “You have Karnataka where there is a BJP government, you have a BJP government at the Centre and you have BJP here. So why is the BJP leadership of Goa not standing up for the rights of Goa?” asked Atishi.

Maharashtra: Reducing debt burden a big challenge for finance minister,"This story is from March 6, 2020

Ajit Pawar

MUMBAI: When deputy CM Ajit Pawar, who also holds the finance and planning portfolios, presents the first budget of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government on Friday, the biggest challenge before him would be to reduce the state’s debt burden of Rs 4.71 lakh crore, tackle the ever-increasing salary burden and mobilize funds for the much-publicized loan waiver scheme.

A top bureaucrat told TOI that the state’s financial condition was crippling owing to massive expenditure on major infrastructure projects, an additional burden of Rs 24,000 crore following implementation of Seventh Pay Commission recommendations and another Rs 21,000 crore for the loan waiver scheme for 30 lakh farmers. “Maharashtra has stood guarantee for infrastructure projects worth Rs 2 lakh crore, including the Metro rail projects in Nagpur, Pune and Nashik, in addition to the Rs 52,000-crore Nagpur-Mumbai Samruddhi Mahamarg. It is believed that if the corporations set up for these projects fail to earn adequate profits, it will be the state government’s responsibility to make payments,” he said.

Secondly, the bureaucrat said, huge funds (Rs 30,000 crore) have been raised for the CM rural roads scheme, Rs 2,000 crore for agriculture pumps, Rs 16,000 crore for farmers welfare scheme, and these funds have been raised from the open market. “More shocking is the fact that the government takes loan for repayment of interest on loans. It is high time we set up an independent organization headed by a financial expert for restructuring of loans,” the bureaucrat said.

He pointed out the Congress-NCP government had presented a white paper on the state’s economy in 1999, and an identical paper was present by the BJP-led government in 2014, but no steps were taken for implementing recommendations in the two papers. More emphasis was placed on winding up loss-making state-run corporations and reducing expenditure on salaries. From 2009 to 2020, the debt burden increased from Rs 1.81 lakh crore to Rs 4.71 lakh crore, while expenditure on salary increased from Rs 34,668 crore to Rs 1.15 lakh crore. Similarly, there was a multifold increase in the cost of pension.

Another setback was lessthan-expected receipt of compensation on GST collected from the state. “For October-November, we received Rs 2,356 crore against Rs 4,500 crore,” he said.

14-15 BJP MLAs in touch with us: Maharashtra minister,"This story is from March 6, 2020

Jayant Patil

MUMBAI: Maharashtra minister Jayant Patil has claimed that 14-15 BJP MLAs from the state are in touch with Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi, but the ruling alliance is not willing to commit the mistake of ""poaching"" Opposition leaders.

Patil's comment came in the wake of a Congress allegation that BJP was carrying out an Operation Lotus in Madhya Pradesh to bring down the Kamal Nath government.

Patil, who is Maharashtra NCP chief, accused BJP of being desperate for power. ""Fourteen to 15 MLAs of the opposition party are in touch with us even today. We have to do their work as we share good relations with them (the MLAs). We understand their mindset,"" Patil told reporters outside the state legislature complex here.

""Yet, it is not right to poach legislators...We don't intend to make that mistake. Our focus is on ensuring our government sustains,"" he added.

BJP emerged as the single largest party in Maharashtra after the assembly polls in October last year. But it failed to form the government after the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena snapped ties with it over sharing the chief ministerial post.

Congress on Wednesday alleged a ""poaching"" bid on its MLAs and allies by Opposition BJP in Madhya Pradesh. BJP, however, denied any move to topple the Kamal Nath government, which is surviving on support of over half a dozen Independent, SP and BSP MLAs, and asked the ruling party to keep its own house in order.

Nath asserted that there was no threat to his government.

Ruckus in BMC after BJP denied opposition leader's post,"This story is from March 6, 2020

BJP corporators protest outside the BMC general body meeting on Thursday

MUMBAI: Shiv Sena corporator and mayor, Kishori Pednekar, turned down the BJP's request to have its corporator as the opposition leader at the civic body meeting on Thursday. This led to an altercation between the two former alliance partners with the BJP corporators walking out of the meeting, raising slogans against the Sena.

City BJP chief, Mangal Prabhat Lodha, had written to the mayor last week seeking Mulund corporator, Prabhakar Shinde, be announced as the party's group leader as well as opposition party leader, replacing existing group leader, Manoj Kotak, who became an MP last year.

At Thursday's meeting, while Shinde's name was announced as the group leader, the mayor subtly said the name of opposition leader in the BMC was already announced in 2017. Following the civic elections in 2017, the BJP had refused to sit in the opposition. This gave the Congress, which was the third largest party, an opportunity to stake claim as opposition.

Following the mayor's indirect refusal to give them the opposition party leader's post, all 80-plus corporators of the BJP started shouting slogans against the mayor and the Sena. They later walked out of the meeting and raised slogans outside the House. ""We followed a democratic process by writing to the mayor and even sought to raise our grievance when we were denied the opposition party leader's post, but this was not allowed while the House was in the progress,"" said Prabhakar Shinde.

The BJP said that with the Congress and Sena already in alliance in the state government, the Sena is ensuring that the Congress remains the opposition leader in the civic body also in a bid to wield its clout. However, Ravi Raja, opposition party leader in the BMC, rubbished the claims. ""They are confused. Following the 2017 civic elections, their own party leader had refused to take the opposition party leader's post despite being the second largest party in the BMC.""

Maharashtra CM gets mail: Seven-year-old sends her wishlist for country,"This story is from March 6, 2020

Khanak Saboo

MUMBAI: Communal harmony and peace, a safer country for women and children, access to food and water for all and green energy. This is what seven-year-old, Khanak Saboo, wants for her country. But she didn't just stop at penning her vision of an ideal India. She recently mailed her wishlist to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.

""People should not fight because of religion. People should respect each other and stay like brothers and sisters,"" she says in the letter. In the 16-point list, Khanak, a student of Children's Academy in Malad, suggests free access to basic needs like food, school and hospitals. She also demands strict action against those who ""throw acid"" or are involved in ""bad touch to women and children...""

In addition to a call for a plastic ban, Khanak writes, ""All cars and autorickshaws should have PUC so we have clean air to breathe. People should care about nature by not wasting water and by using green energy.""

The letter was also mailed to union minister Amit Shah and the PM. Khanak has got a response from the CM who, in a letter to her father, Vipin Saboo, has said, ""A cursory, yet curious look at the note reveals the young mind's flight of thinking on a subject, which appears difficult for grown-ups, let alone a girl of her age. I appreciate her talent, high thinking and foresight at this tender age.""

"AIADMK is being projected as anti-Hindu, says BJP leader H Raja","This story is from March 4, 2020

H Raja

CHENNAI: BJP national secretary H Raja on Tuesday alleged that a section in the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR & CE) department was trying to project the AIADMK government as ""anti-Hindu"" and urged the state not to fall prey to their ploy by allocating temple land to encroachers.

Talking to reporters after taking part in the BJP's core committee meeting, which was chaired by national general secretary Muralidhar Rao at the party headquarters in Chennai, Raja said the AIADMK government has said it would purchase 600 acres of land of the 4.78 lakh acres of HR &CE land and issue deeds to squatters. The Edappadi K Palaniswami government had issued an order in August last year to regularize and issue property deeds in favour of those in possession of 'objectionable' public land. The BJP has been opposed to it.

Condemning this, the BJP leader said giving temple land, which had been donated by many individuals to temples, is unacceptable. ""The parcels of land are endowment property. Acquiring such properties amount to interference in temple activities and religious practices. It cannot be allowed,"" he said.

Recalling the Madras high court's direction in February 2018, directing the government to submit details of HR & CE properties, Raja said the report was to be submitted within six weeks. But it was not done till date. ""We want the government to implement the court order in letter and spirit, at least now,"" he said.

During the core committee meeting, the party decided to interact with reporters in district headquarters across the state to explain about Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019 to counter the opposition campaign. ""We reviewed the recently held organisation elections and also discussed the ongoing protests in connection with CAA. We have decided to communicate to the people through media to dispel the misinformation campaign against CAA in the coming days,"" said general secretary (headquarters) K S Narendran.

The state government should act immediately against those who are involved in damaging the statues,” said Stalin. “Even when he was alive, he was successful after facing several hurdles. Thus, by damaging his statue, his contribution to society cannot be forgotten,” said Vaiko in a statement. Vaiko wanted the government to take action against those involved in the vandalism. CPI state secretary R Mutharasan, in a statement, condemned the damage to the statues and said a protest will be held on Saturday against the vandalism. “The protest will be held at Chepauk and the party’s youth wing, women’s wing and others will participate,” said Mutharasan. PMK founder S Ramadoss, in a statement, said if there is opposition to what Periyar said, they should be opposed only in the form of debates or policies. “In the last few months, there have been several such incidents of statues of Thiruvalluvar and Periyar being damaged.

Israel's coalition deal: political stability with pitfalls,"File Photo: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu

JERUSALEM: Israel's coalition deal between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz breaks a year-long deadlock but has pitfalls -- from power sharing mechanisms to West Bank policy and the premier's corruption charges.Monday's agreement for a unity government , signed by Netanyahu and parliament speaker Gantz after three inconclusive elections in less than a year, seeks to give the Jewish state desperately-needed political stability as it confronts the coronavirus pandemic.""After a year and a half of political stalemate and as the country endures one of the most severe economic crises in its history, it is high-time for Israel to have a functioning government,"" said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute think-tank.But he warned that the Netanyahu-Gantz deal risks creating a government ""without a grand vision or clear goals"" that would be vulnerable to being bogged down with ""cumbersome political agreements.""Here are the main points of the deal:Implementing the deal will require majority support in Israel's 120-seat parliament, the Knesset.That is likely to happen, assuming it is backed by Netanyahu's unified right-wing bloc and most of Gantz's supporters.Netanyahu will serve as prime minister through the first 18 months of the three-year deal.Gantz will first serve as ""alternate prime minister,"" a new position that must be created through an amendment of Israel's so-called Basic Laws. Passing that amendment is a key part of the coalition deal.After 18 months, Gantz takes over as prime minister, with Netanyahu serving as his alternate.Through the first six months, the government will be defined as an ""emergency"" body focused primarily on containing the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigating the economic devastation it has caused.Israel has more than 13,800 confirmed virus cases, including over 180 deaths, and a nationwide lockdown has left huge numbers of people without an income.Cabinet portfolios are split between the two camps.Key ministries assigned to Netanyahu's side include finance and interior, while Gantz's side will control the defence and justice ministry. The position of foreign minister will rotate.Ministers can only be fired if there is agreement from both sides, and the prime minister cannot sack his alternate.The prime minister was due to face trial on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust last month. The trial's start date was postponed to May 24 because of the pandemic.Under Israeli law, a prime minister can continue to serve while under indictment, but a regular cabinet minister cannot.With his trial, including possible appeals, expected to last several years, the veteran premier did not want to be forced out of government when his term expired.His expected transition to alternate prime minister in 2021 likely solves that problem.Netanyahu's Likud party also retained significant say over the appointment of judges and prosecutors, influence that could help the prime minister as his case moves forward.Legal cases have also been filed by non-government groups seeking to block an individual under indictment from serving as prime minister.Under the coalition deal, if Israel's top court bars Netanyahu from serving, his agreement with Gantz is dissolved and another election will be called.For Netanyahu, US President Donald Trump 's plan for Middle East peace offered Israel an ""historic"" opportunity.The plan -- rejected by the Palestinians and condemned by much of the international community -- gave Israel the green light to annex Jewish settlements and other strategic territory in the occupied West Bank.Such annexations would violate international law and likely inflame tensions in the volatile region.Gantz had praised Trump's controversial plan but was more cautious regarding its implementation.The coalition agreement says that any measures regarding Trump's plan would be executed ""in full agreement of the United States ,"" while maintaining ""international dialogue"" and ""the need to maintain regional stability"".At the same time, with Gantz's permission, Netanyahu can bring Trump's annexation plan to cabinet and parliament for discussion and approval from July 1.Palestinian prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh on Monday condemned the formation of an ""Israeli annexation government,"" saying it marked the end of the two-state solution.","File Photo: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin NetanyahuJERUSALEM: Israel's coalition deal between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz breaks a year-long deadlock but has pitfalls -- from power sharing mechanisms to West Bank policy and the premier's corruption charges.Monday's agreement for a unity government , signed by Netanyahu and parliament speaker Gantz after three inconclusive elections in less than a year, seeks to give the Jewish state desperately-needed political stability as it confronts the coronavirus pandemic.

"Not only holding polls, being arrested also part of political process: NC leader","SRINAGAR: Holding Assembly elections in the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir should not be the only goal of mainstream politicians and being arrested is also part of the political process , National Conference leader Ruhullah Mehdi has said.

""Many of my colleagues are detained under the PSA. Others including me are put under house detention . My heart goes out to them and I wish & pray for their immediate release. But, believe me their and our (house) detention is a political message and process itself,"" he tweeted on Sunday.

In a series of tweets, Mehdi said the political leaders of Kashmir should not be seeking permission from the government for various things as it would mean doing only what the government wants them to do.

A former cabinet minister of the erstwhile state of J&K and a three-time legislator, Mehdi said he was ready to be taken from his home to a prison but would not ask permission of the government to do what he wants.

""I am currently under house detention and I am honestly ready to be taken to a prison after what I say. But I would never ask them to LET us. When you ask them to LET us, it will naturally be on their terms,"" the chief spokesperson of the NC said.

"" Revisit domicile law? Lift curbs on Internet? 'LET' political process be run? Is that all what you are looking for in this reconciliation? If I am not reading wrong, you are basically asking for 4G (internet) and THEIR 'PERMISSION' to let us start the political process? & then all is well? he further said.

He said while the government was doing a job, the hands of local leaders were not tied.

""They are doing job. Our hands aren't tied. Our thoughts aren't tied. If the objective is not only elections, we are only in a political process. Asking them to let us start means doing only what they want us to do,"" he said.

His tweets were in response to an article by his party colleague Tanvir Sadiq in a local daily. Sadiq had called for the release of all political leaders including Mehbooba Mufti,Â Ali Muhammad Sagar and Shah Faesal , besides restoration of all means of communication. He had also called on the government to allow resumption of the political process.

""This provokes a question in my mind. What is a political process for you? Only an election? If we go with a reason and stand our course, even being detained is a part of political process.""

","But, believe me their and our (house) detention is a political message and process itself,"" he tweeted on Sunday.

Manish Sisodia seeks Delhi’s share in central taxes,"This story is from February 22, 2020

<p>Nirmala Sitharaman and Manish Sisodia<br></p>

NEW DELHI: In a meeting with Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday, deputy chief minister and state finance minister Manish Sisodia sought a share for Delhi in central taxes, besides allocation of funds for the three corporations on the lines of the Centre providing funds to local bodies of other states.

Delhi government gets a grant in lieu of a share in central taxes, which has remained stagnant at Rs 325 crore since 2001-02. “I urged the Union finance minister to give a share in the central taxes so that work can be expedited on establishing more schools and hospitals, Yamuna is cleaned and adequate water and electricity is supplied in the city,” Sisodia said.

In a letter addressed to Sitharaman, Sisodia referred to the erstwhile Article 270(3) of the Constitution, which defined the share of taxes between the Centre and Union territories. Omission of Article 270(3) in the year 2000 has resulted in Delhi not receiving its rightful share in central taxes.

“The Constitution (80th Amendment) Act, 2000 was passed by Parliament primarily for including corporation tax with personal income tax for resource sharing between states and the Union government. It replaced Article 270 with a new set of provisions. This has had an adverse impact on the state’s finances,” Sisodia mentioned in the letter.

The deputy CM further said: “The 15th Finance Commission in its report for financial year 2020-21 has provided 1% of the divisible pool for the newly formed Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh and assigns the same to the central government. As you are aware, J&K and Delhi are on a similar footing within the Constitution as UTs with legislature. Accordingly, additional terms of reference to the finance commission would bring justice to the people of Delhi and rectify the anomaly created by the inadvertent omission of Article 270(3).”

Sisodia also said that Delhi has not been given any share in central taxes since 2001. “It is important to mention that 42% of central taxes are given to all other states based on the recommendations of the finance commission. Before 2001, Delhi also used to get a share in it,” he added.

Highlighting that Delhi government needs to make large investments in education, health, social welfare, food security, transport, roads, healthcare and other sectors, Sisodia said that if Article 270(3) had not been omitted, then Delhi would have been getting Rs 7,000 crore annually as share from central taxes.

“I requested for funds for the municipal corporations of Delhi in the same way as other states get from the central government,” Sisodia said.

Sisodia also referred to the recommendations of the Arjun Sengupta Committee according to which the central government had in 1997-98 agreed to bring the funding pattern of Union Territories similar to that of other states.

","Delhi government gets a grant in lieu of a share in central taxes, which has remained stagnant at Rs 325 crore since 2001-02.
“I urged the Union finance minister to give a share in the central taxes so that work can be expedited on establishing more schools and hospitals, Yamuna is cleaned and adequate water and electricity is supplied in the city,” Sisodia said.
Omission of Article 270(3) in the year 2000 has resulted in Delhi not receiving its rightful share in central taxes.
“It is important to mention that 42% of central taxes are given to all other states based on the recommendations of the finance commission.

Gujarat: Political parties nervous ahead of Rajya Sabha poll,"Eight Congress MLAs cross-voted against the mandate and in favour of BJP candidates while one BJP MLA had cast... Read More

GANDHINAGAR: With just a day left before the crucial Rajya Sabha (RS) election of four seats in Gujarat, there is considerable anxiety in both the BJP and Congress parties. While the Congress cannot rule out the possibility of cross-voting by some of its MLAs like in the 2017 RS election, the BJP is bothered by the likelihood of its MLAs casting invalid votes like the 2017 RS poll.

Eight Congress MLAs had cross-voted against the mandate and in favour of BJP candidates while one BJP MLA had cast an invalid vote in the 2017 election, which saw veteran Congress leader Ahmed Patel win his RS seat with a wafer-thin margin.

Although the Congress is already short of the required numbers to ensure outright wins for both of its candidates, senior party leaders admit that a few Congress MLAs could cross vote in favour of BJP candidates despite the fact that they have been showing solidarity with the Congress as of now.

In 2017, then leader of opposition (LOP) and senior Congress leader Shankersinh Vaghela, his son Mahendrasinh Vaghela and six other MLAs had cross-voted for BJP. Just prior to the 2017 RS election, six Congress MLAs had resigned to join the BJP subsequently.

In 2017, a total of 14 Congress MLAs had attempted to damage the party’s prospects in the RS election. The votes of two Congress MLAs, namely Raghavji Patel and Bholabhai Gohil , were declared invalid, as they failed to follow the prescribed process and showed their vote to the BJP agent instead of the Congress agent.

A senior Congress leader who preferred not to be named, said, “At present, all the remaining 65 MLAs have pledged allegiance to the Congress, but we cannot be completely sure if they will vote for Congress candidates. In 2017, some MLAs voted against the Congress candidate despite staying with the others at a resort in Karnataka. Things will be clear only on voting day.”

A BJP leader claimed that between three and five Congress MLAs will cross-vote in the election on Friday. “Although we have conducted intensive training for our MLAs, the fear of invalid votes remains. Even if there is no cross-voting by Congress MLAs, we will comfortably win three seats on the basis of second preference votes,” the leader said.

While the Congress has fielded its senior leaders Shaktisinh Gohil and Bharatsinh Solanki , the ruling BJP has nominated Abhay Bhardwaj, Ramilaben Bara and Narhari Amin as its candidates for the polls, in which MLAs will vote.

Vladimir Putin: Coronavirus upends Putin's political agenda in Russia,"MOSCOW: Spring is not turning out the way Russian President Vladimir Putin might have planned it.A nationwide vote on April 22 was supposed to finalize sweeping constitutional reforms that would allow him to stay in power until 2036, if he wished. But after the coronavirus spread in Russia, that plebiscite had to be postponed - an action so abrupt that billboards promoting it already had been erected in Moscow and other big cities.Now under threat is a pomp-filled celebration of Victory Day on May 9, marking the 1945 defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.The holiday has become the most important on Russia's calendar, and this year is the 75th anniversary, with world leaders invited to a celebration highlighting the country's exceptional role in history. Every year, thousands gather in Moscow, including many elderly veterans proudly wearing their medals.Military units have already rehearsed the traditional Red Square parade, drilling outside Moscow, and leaders such as France's Emmanuel Macron and India's Narendra Modi had promised to attend.It would seem impossible to have such a gala now, with much of Russia and the world locked down to stop the spread of the virus.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week no decision has been made on whether to postpone it but authorities are considering ""options,"" one of which is to hold it without the veterans, a group especially vulnerable to the virus. Peskov added the Kremlin would understand if foreign leaders decided not to come due to the pandemic and added the celebration would take place even if it doesn't happen on May 9.Initially underestimated by Russian authorities, the pandemic has posed an unexpected challenge for Putin, whose political standing now depends on whether he can contain the damage from it.On March 24, Putin was shown donning a yellow hazmat suit to visit a hospital for infected patients.Officials then indefinitely postponed the vote on the constitutional reforms that would have allowed Putin to serve two more six-year terms after 2024. The amendments already have been approved by lawmakers but the government wanted nationwide balloting to give the changes a democratic veneer. Campaigns promoting the vote had already kicked off in dozens of Russian regions.In preparation for the vote and Victory Day, Russia's state news agency Tass had begun releasing parts of a three-hour interview with Putin, with the 67-year-old leader talking about what he had done for the country in the past 20 years and what more needs to be accomplished. But Tass suspended daily extracts of the interview, saying it was no longer relevant to an audience more concerned about the coronavirus.The outbreak has completely reset the Kremlin's political agenda, said Nikolai Petrov, a senior research fellow in Chatham House's Russia and Eurasia Program.""Everything that was happening before (the outbreak) has basically been wiped out,"" Petrov told The Associated Press. ""That whole political agenda (of constitutional reform), that had been unfolding since mid-January is over.""He added that for the moment, ""I think we can forget about the constitutional amendments.""The coronavirus crisis presents many difficulties for Putin, whose approval ratings - steadily dropping in the past two years - reached 63% in March - the lowest since 2013.It comes as the prices of oil, Russia's main source of income, plummeted amid a price war with Saudi Arabia, causing a sharp drop in the ruble. The pandemic brought with it the prospects of more economic devastation.As much of Russia went into lockdown, which Putin sugarcoated by describing it as ""nonworking days,"" many business operations came to a halt, prompting fears of a mass shutdown by companies and leaving millions unemployed.The Chamber for Trade and Industries, a government-backed business association, predicted 3 million companies could go out of business and 8 million people - almost 11% of Russia's working population - could end up jobless.A weakening economy and worsening living conditions, widely seen by analysts as the driving force behind Putin's souring ratings, have already become the dominating fear among Russians. With the crisis still unfolding, it is likely to hurt his standing even more, said Denis Volkov, a sociologist with the independent Levada polling center.When people start fearing things getting worse ``then the ratings start plummeting,'' Volkov told the AP.The Kremlin's response to the crisis has raised questions at home and abroad.Domestically, Putin has been widely criticized for paying little attention to the epidemic at first, and then for distancing himself from it by delegating difficult decisions on lockdowns to regional governments and the Cabinet.Some in the West have questioned the low number of official virus cases in Russia and dismissed its widely publicized effort to send planeloads of medical aid to Italy, the U.S., Serbia and other countries as a PR stunt.Putin sought to reassure the nation in a TV address on April 8, but part of his message comparing the coronavirus to invaders from the 10th and 11th centuries brought mockery on social media instead.""Our country went through many serious challenges. It was tormented by the Pechenegs and the Cumans, and Russia got through all of it. We will defeat this coronavirus bug, too,'' Putin said.Social media users pointed out that not only did Putin use this line in 2010, he might have borrowed it from an anecdote from the 19th century.""The risks of him (Putin) looking out of touch are very real,'' Samuel Greene, director of the Russia Institute at the King's College London, told the AP.Putin used to be able to regain control of the political agenda by shifting the focus from domestic hardships to Russia's geopolitical grandeur, rallying people around the 2014 annexation of Crimea or fighting what he called terrorists in Syria. But this time, as Russia is forced to confront a truly global crisis, that tactic seems much harder.""There can be nothing that would interest people more than the hardship they are going through and will continue to go through for a long time,"" said Petrov.","The amendments already have been approved by lawmakers but the government wanted nationwide balloting to give the changes a democratic veneer.

Political slugfest starts over SEC’s removal,"VIJAYAWADA: The ordinance brought in by the state government which abruptly ended the service of incumbent state commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar has sparked off a political slugfest. Opposition parties have launched an attack on chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy, accusing him of resorting to vendetta politics.

The TDP alleged the decision to remove Ramesh Kumar was a result of “Jagan’s personal vengeance”. “While the whole world is fighting with Covid-19, the chief minister is busy in taking vengeance against the officers, who followed the rules instead of his dictum,” said former minister K Atchennaidu .

Taking a dig at the statements given by the ministers that even opposition leader N Chandrababu Naidu should undergo quarantine for 14 days if he comes to the state from Hyderabad, Atchennaidu asked how did the state government allow Justice V Kanagaraj, who is from Tamil Nadu and is now settled in New Delhi, which are among the worst affected states with Covid-19, to enter AP. He also wanted the new SEC to undergo a 14-day quarantine period.

BJP state president Kanna Lakshminarayana wrote to the central election commission (CEC) and to governor Biswabhushan Harichandan , alleging the state government issued the ordinance to take vengeance on the incumbent state election commissioner, who took the decision to postpone the election process in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Hitting back at the opposition, the YSRC said opposition parties do not want a Dalit and expert in judiciary to be appointed as SEC. Ambati Rambabu, official spokesperson of YSRC, said the statements by TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu indicate he does not want a Dalit intellectual to be appointed as SEC.

‘Gehlot scripts political drama to divert attention from Covid failure’,"Ahead of

on June 19, state BJP president Satish Poonia is confident that both

of the party will be elected. In an interview with TOI’s Shoeb Khan, Poonia refuted

’s horse-trading of MLAs allegations against BJP and said that this political drama by the CM is scripted to divert attention from state’s failure in dealing with Covid-19 pandemic. Excerpts:

CM Ashok Gehlot has handed over the investigation of his MLAs being lured by BJP to the SOG. Your say?

BJP has fielded two candidates for Rajya Sabha when you don’t have the numbers in the assembly. How will you ensure that both win?

Your party had initially extended support to the government in fighting Covid. What has changed now for BJP to question the government efforts?

What could have been done differently to deal with the pandemic?

It’s a political drama by chief minister Ashok Gehlot. His allegations are baseless and senseless. He is repeatedly accusing our party, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah , which is unacceptable. I challenge him to prove his allegations or face legal action.Our first 51 MLAs will cast their vote for the party’s first preference Rajendra Gehlot, while the rest 24 will support our second candidate Onkar Singh Lakhawat. We have already made an appeal that independent and lawmakers of other parties who feel that Gehlot government has failed to deliver should support our second candidate. A lot of infighting and disappointment brews in the government. People are unhappy and there would be those who support us. We are being totally transparent and fair about it.We had assured and were supporting the government in fighting the pandemic. We had given the list of suggestions, some of which were also implemented. However, we noticed that Gehlot ji was turning it into a political debate by blaming the central government for everything. Gehlot government has been trying to build an impression that the Centre has done nothing. It is a blatant lie. From day one, the Centre has extended all possible help to all states. Modi government has allocated much bigger amount than what Gehlot has been demanding Rs 1 lakh crore to all states. How can Gehlot deny the medical, technical and financial assistance provided by the Centre to Rajasthan. Our PM is holding a meet with the CMs repeatedly. Teams from the ICMR and AIIMS are taking stock of things in the state show the support from the Centre.Three things poorly executed by the Gehlot government would have made a great impact on our fight against the Covid. They failed to carry out proper screening at the airport which was discussed in the assembly on February 20. Secondly, the grassroots workers like asha sahyogini, patwari and city bodies representatives could have been activated way before the spread for carrying out surveys, awareness campaigns and mapping of possible hotspot/vulnerable areas. It took Gehlot 69 days to engage public representatives via video conferencing. It could have done much earlier.","In an interview with TOI’s Shoeb Khan, Poonia refuted’s horse-trading of MLAs allegations against BJP and said that this political drama by the CM is scripted to divert attention from state’s failure in dealing with Covid-19 pandemic.

Will cut power supply to Punjab CM's home: AAP,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Amarinder Singh

CHANDIGARH: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has threatened to disconnect power supply to chief minister Amarinder Singh's home in Patiala if the Congress government did not scrap power purchase agreements (PPAs) with private companies during the upcoming budget session.

The decision was taken in a meeting of party MLAs convened by leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema ahead of the assembly session. At the meeting, MLAs hailed AAP's win in Delhi.

Cheema added if Punjab government did not provide relief to people from electricity prices, AAP would be forced to cut the electricity connection of Amarinder's residence and the campaign will be followed by cutting connections of the residences of Congress ministers, MLAs and MPs.

Parties publishing candidates’ criminal cases of little use: Analysts,"This story is from February 15, 2020

BENGALURU: Political analysts say the Supreme Court’s order to parties, instructing them to publish the entire criminal history of candidates, is a step in the right direction but it is unlikely to clear up the system.

They say the only way forward is either for voters to show zero tolerance for candidates with criminal antecedents, or parties to stay clear of fielding such candidates.

“We welcome the SC order, but it is just a step,” said L Vasudev Murthy, an educationist from Bengaluru. “Unless political parties stand up and decide against fielding candidates with criminal background, no amount of legislation will help contain the menace.”

The SC on Thursday ordered political parties to publish the criminal history of candidates for assembly and Lok Sabha elections along with reasons that forced them to field “suspected criminals over decent people”.

The information must be published in a local as well as a national newspaper besides the parties’ social media handles within 48 hours of selection of candidates or less than two weeks before the first date for filing of nominations, whichever is earlier.

“This information [criminal cases] is already out there in public domain and publishing it again will be of little use,” said Trilochan Shastry of Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR). “It will not solve the problem of criminalisation of politics. However, the Supreme Court seems to feel that it cannot go beyond this step.”

ADR, a body which aims to improve governance and strengthen democracy through electoral and political reforms, has been creating awareness among voters by publishing criminals antecedents of candidates. The information is sourced from candidates’ sworn affidavits.

However, AT Ramaswamy, JD(S) MLA, who has been fighting against encroachment of government land, welcomed the move while expressing hope that it will address the problem to some extent.

“Currently, all candidates declare cases filed against them in their election affidavits, but not many people know about it,” Ramaswamy said. “Now, the onus is on political parties to explain to people why they gave a ticket to a candidate with criminal antecedents. So, parties will have to be careful while selecting candidates. I welcome the SC order.”

End monopolistic rights on Gurbani telecast: Punjab cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa,"This story is from February 15, 2020

A delegation meets Giani Harpreet Singh to seek his intervention in the matter

AMRITSAR: Punjab cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa led a delegation of Sikh leaders to meet acting Akal Takht jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh. They sought his intervention to end the monopoly on the live telecast of Gurbani from Golden Temple and to facilitate the availability of a signal to all channels within the framework of guidelines.

Talking to mediapersons later, the panchayat and rural development minister said Gurbani was not a commodity and could not be traded. “The message of the gurus articulated in the Gurbani must be taken to every corner of the world for free rather than be made a business,” he said.

Saying that the jathedar assured him of looking into the matter, Bajwa condemned the monopoly rights given by SGPC to a TV channel owned by the SAD (B) president on the grounds that it violated the basic tenets and teachings of the Gurbani.

“The signal should be made available free of cost to every channel interested in spreading Gurbani after getting an undertaking on observing the norms laid down,” he said, adding that the SGPC should make its own arrangements for distribution of signal. He also pointed out that more than two decades after the proposal for setting up of a channel by SGPC, nothing had been done on the ground.

Punjab: Parkash Singh Badal’s BJP jibe morale booster for SAD cadres,"This story is from February 15, 2020

Prakash Singh Badal

JALANDHAR: While political leaders and experts are trying to figure out the reasons behind Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) patron Parkash Singh Badal’s indirect jibe at ally BJP over “discrimination on basis of religion”, Akali cadres are feeling elated by it.

The boost of assertiveness has come at a time when Akalis were reeling under the treatment meted out to them by BJP in Delhi. The saffron party did not do well in Delhi polls, giving a breather to SAD. Akali cadres are happy that the former chief min-ster has sho-wn mirror to BJP, putting it in dock over its brand of politics. On the other hand, BJP functionaries may also find it tough to hit back at Badal given his age and stature, about which they themselves had been gushing.

SAD insiders said that they were happy at the remarks as BJP appeared to be embarrassing Akalis by moves in Delhi and also by asserting that in 2022, they would be the senior partner in the alliance in Punjab. The developments in Delhi had come when SAD was facing attacks from dissidents and Rajya Sabha member Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa had managed to bring them on one platform.

“These remarks have boosted morale of our cadres. Some had earlier called up to say that they were finding it difficult to explain party position to ground workers or people regarding Delhi poll drama. What’s more, sentiment in Punjab, especially among Sikhs, is against exclusion of Muslims from CAA and recent provocative statements by a few BJP leaders in Delhi elections,” said a SAD functionary, who also happens to be a SGPC member.

“It will also send a message to Punjab BJP leaders whose repeated statements to contest on more seats has been embarrassing Akalis,” said another Akali leader.

"Punjab: NHM stops free girl care, reverses order day later","This story is from February 15, 2020

Representative image

BATHINDA: In a flip-flop, the National Health Mission (NHM) withdrew its orders on Friday of stopping free treatment facility to girls up to the age of 5 and for first 24 hours in emergency cases after the admission of patients in government hospitals in Punjab.

State-run hospitals had stopped free treatment on Thursday after the director health services wrote to officials of the department in all 22 districts of Punjab and three government medical colleges, informing them that the Union government had not approved the scheme of free treatment to girl child up to 5 years in the programme implementation plans (PIP) 2019-20.

A total of Rs 1,054.82 crore has been approved under NHM for Punjab’s PIP for the financial year 2019-20 for various purposes, including immunisation.

Patients heading for emergency and getting treatment for small girls were taken by surprise when they were asked to pay. “We were told to pay for stitches, dressing applied on our four-year-old daughter. Earlier the treatment was free,” said Karamjit Kaur of Bathinda, who had taken her daughter for treatment at a government hospital.

On January 31, NMH Punjab had written to the director, health services (family welfare), that the approval had not been given in PIP 2019-20 for free treatment to girl child up to 5 years and free treatment for first 24 hours in emergency. Following the letter, the health department had written to all district officials on February 10 and free treatment facility was stopped on Thursday, sources in the health department said.

Bathinda civil surgeon Dr Amrik Sandhu said, “Free facility was stopped in some of the components of the treatment like medicines for various types of operations but the accidental cases are being handled as previously. It was being done as the Union government has not approved two schemes under Punjab NHM.”

When contacted, Punjab NHM mission director Kumar Rahul said, “The health authorities had some misunderstanding. Actually, along with the girl child, everyone is being given free treatment with a small token money on issuing the treatment slip. We have withdrawn the wrongly issued orders and free treatment facility will continue.”

"Former MP from Ajnala, son rejoin SAD","This story is from February 14, 2020

Parkash Singh Badal and Sukhbir Badal welcome Amarpal Singh Bony Ajnala into the party fold at Rosh Rally on T... Read More

AJNALA: Former Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) (B) MLA from Ajnala assembly constituency, Amarpal Singh Bony Ajnala bid adieu to recently constituted SAD (Taksali) to join SAD (B) on Thursday.

SAD (B) president Sukhbir Singh Badal went to Bony’s home in Ajnala ahead of Rosh Rally where he was accorded a warm welcome by Bony and his former member parliament father, Rattan Singh Ajnala.

Bony went to the rally at Rajasansi with Sukhbir and was also seen on the stage where SAD (B) patron Parkash Singh Badal welcomed his homecoming with siropa (robe of honour) while other Akali leadership expressed hope of homecoming of rest of the dissidents. On the eve of rally, Bony had met Sukhbir in a hotel.

Sources privy to the ‘patch up’ said a compromise had been struck between Ajnalas and Badals. “The possibility is that Bony could be given party ticket in 2022 assembly elections while his father could also be adjusted on some prominent post in the party,” said sources.

In 2018, Ajnalas had resigned from SAD (B) to form SAD (Taksali) alleging that they were not being consulted by SAD (B) while making decisions, including giving pardon to controversial Gurmeet Ram Raheem.

On the homecoming of Bony, senior Badal said the party had done everything for the Taksali Akalis. He said they were given ministries and plum posts in the party, including vice presidents. He said he wished the dissidents should realise their mistake soon.

When asked if Ajnala had also joined the party formally, SAD (B) Amritsar district president Gurpartap Singh Tikka said “The family has welcomed Sukhbir in their house, which means Ajanala family has joined the SAD (B).

SAD (T) president Ranjit Singh Brahampura said, “People join and leave the parties. One person doesn’t make much difference, who knows many leaders from SAD (B) will be joining us soon.” He also said as far as he knew, Ajnala has not joined SAD (B). “He must be feeling embarrassed over his son’s act,” he added.

"Guv spars with TMC leaders, focuses on intra-party politics","Kolkata: Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Saturday sparred with individual Trinamool Congress leaders, taking his “constitutional responsibility” beyond scrutiny of state government activities to focusing on the state’s ruling party.

Kolkata Municipal Corporation board of administrators chairperson Firhad Hakim, Trinamool MP Mahua Moitra and Trinamool’s Rajya Sabha leader Derek O’Brien came in the line of fire.

Dhankhar wasn’t satisfied with the state government’s positive response to his flagging the “sordid saga” of 14 unclaimed dead bodies taken to Garia crematorium. He wanted Hakim to personally meet him at Raj Bhavan even after KMC commissioner Vinod Kumar gave a detailed update of the Garia incident and also admitted the lapses. Instead, the governor conveyed to Kumar that Hakim should see him at the earliest to discuss the “unprecedented suffering in Kolkata over a week post-Amphan due to KMC”.

Hakim kept up his defiance and said on Saturday he was not going to pay a visit to Raj Bhavan.

“The governor is the head of state and there is no reason why I won’t meet him. But he made the tweet earlier and then requested me to see him. And more, he is acting on behalf of a party, BJP. As head of the state, the governor didn’t even sympathise with the KMC team working overtime against the challenges — Covid, Amphan and dengue. He kept training his guns when the state government is laying down rules and procedure for cremating the dead,” Hakim said.

Dhankhar tweeted on Saturday morning asking for “apology to the society at large” over the “ghastly episode that has shocked all”.

The state home department responded within hours saying: “GOWB respects the credo of dignity at death and, while handling the Covid pandemic, it has espoused the principle by laying down transparent procedures regarding disclosure of facts, opportunities given to bereaved relatives for showing last respect to the deceased, disposal of dead bodies etc.”

The governor then switched to TMC MP Moitra’s recent comments on utilisation of funds by panchayats in Nadia for construction of rural roads. “Sharp and well-aimed arrows against her own government were lethal and the rampant corruption issue in the state prominently flagged, panchayat corruption took centre stage — reminding all about ‘cut money’ stated to be all pervasive,” he wrote.

Moitra shot back, saying: “Firing BJP arrows at state govt which is handling Covid, Amphan & migrant return smoothly all at once. A (rotten) apple never falls far from the tree. Three-pronged battle. The governor is aiming at the state government with political arrows.” Dhankhar continued with the repartee and tweeted: “Knives that were being sharpened @MamataOfficial are now out to take on the governor.”

Next came Derek. “Now, for about two weeks, I have been urging you to reveal the number of pending results for (Covid) test reports. I had indicated that reports pendi-ng are in thousands,” the governor tweeted. Derek re-lied: “It seems now he (Guv Dh-ankhar) has been officially appointed as BJP spokes-person… He is trying to set up the BJP narrative for Bengal.”

NEW DELHI: Nepal's Parliament on Saturday unanimously voted to amend the Constitution to update the country's new political map, laying claim over the strategically key areas of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura along the border with India.Major opposition parties including Nepali Congress (NC), Rastriya Janata Party-Nepal (RJP-N) and Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) voted in favour of the government bill to amend Schedule 3 of the Constitution to update the national emblem by incorporating the new controversial map.Two-thirds majority of the 275-member lower house was required to pass the bill.The bill will now be sent to the National Assembly (NA) where it will undergo a similar process.The NA will have to give lawmakers 72 hours to move amendments against the bill's provisions, if any.After the National Assembly passes the bill, it will be submitted to the President for authentication, after which the bill will be incorporated in the Constitution.On June 9, the Parliament unanimously endorsed a proposal to consider the bill to pave way for endorsing the new map.The government on Wednesday formed a nine-member team of experts to collect historical facts and evidence related to the area.Diplomats and experts, however, questioned the government's move, asking why the task force was formed when the map has already been released and approved by the Cabinet.The ties between India and Nepal came under strain after defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated a 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8.Nepal reacted sharply to the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through Nepalese territory.

KATHMANDU: Nepal Parliament 's special session began on Saturday to discuss a key Constitution amendment bill tabled by the government to revise the country's political map, laying claim over the strategically key areas of Lipulekh , Kalapani and Limpiyadhura along the border with India.

The House of Representatives opened the discussion on the amendment bill which will be put for voting after the deliberations are over, said spokesman at the Parliament Rojnath Pandey.

He said the House has been working to put the bill to vote on Saturday.

Endorsement of the bill is certain as the Opposition Nepali Congress and Janata Samajwadi Party-Nepal have vowed to back for the government bill to amend Schedule 3 of the constitution to update the national emblem by incorporating the new map, sources said.

The bill will be endorsed through a consensus, a senior minister told PTI.

Two-thirds majority of the 275-member Lower House is required to pass the bill.

Once the bill is passed by the Lower House, it will be sent to the National Assembly where it will undergo a similar process.

The NA will have to give lawmakers 72 hours to move amendments against the bill's provisions, if any.

After the National Assembly passes the bill, it will be submitted to the President for authentication, after which the bill will be incorporated in the Constitution.

On June 9, the Parliament unanimously endorsed a proposal to consider the bill to pave way for endorsing the new map.

The government on Wednesday formed a nine-member team of experts to collect historical facts and evidence related to the area.

Diplomats and experts, however, questioned the government's move, asking why the task force was formed when the map has already been released and approved by the Cabinet.

The ties between India and Nepal came under strain after defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated a 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8.

Nepal reacted sharply to the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through Nepalese territory. India rejected the claim asserting that the road lies completely within its territory.

Nepal last month released the revised political and administrative map of the country laying claim over the strategically key areas. India has been maintaining that these three areas belonged to it.

India sternly asked Nepal not to resort to any ""artificial enlargement"" of territorial claims after Kathmandu released the new map.

Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli earlier this month said that his government will seek a solution to the Kalapani issue through diplomatic efforts and dialogue on the basis of historical facts and documents.

Congress says decision to suspend MPLAD politically motivated,"NEW DELHI: Congress on Monday welcomed the cabinet’s decision to reduce salaries of members of parliament to tide over the financial crisis triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, but said the government must revisit its decision to suspend MP Local Area Development funds for two years and pool them into the Consolidated Fund of India.Congress Rajya Sabha MP Ahmed Patel welcomed the salary cut but said the government should scrap the Central Vista redevelopment project and all other non-Covid-19 publicity expenses.Congress MPs also said suspending MPLAD funds would undermine the role of an MP and rob their constituents of funds necessary for their development. Referring to the suspension of MPLADS as an “overstretch” that needs to be restored, Manish Tewari said this was a knee jerk reaction much like the sudden lockdown and that it will hurt the poor. “Hon’ble PM Modi - As an MP who represents a predominately rural constituency I fully support the 30 pc cut in my salary. However the suspension of MPLADS is a bit of an overstretch,” he said.Trivandrum MP Shashi Tharoor echoed the party view on the decision to cut salaries and pensions but said ending MPLADS funds for two years is “problematic”. “An order to earmark all MPLAD spending for Covid-19 related measures would have been okay. I used mine to get urgently-needed rapid test kits and PPE to Thiruvananthapuram ’s health workers,” Tharoor said on Twitter.Congress MP Manicka Tagore also said the unilateral decision by the government, without due consultations with MPs, appeared politically motivated and that though Congress stood with the government in combating coronavirus, the government should reconsider its decision keeping in mind its impact on the development needs of MPs’ constituencies.Similar sentiments over the cancellation of MPLADs were expressed by NCP MP Supriya Sule and RJD MP Manoj Jha , both of them asking whether the government could offer an assurance that funds taken away from their MPLAD quota would be spent in their constituencies.Congress MP Jairam Ramesh , however, welcomed the government’s decision on MPLADS. “I welcome the decision on MPLADS. I have been arguing for long that the approximately Rs 7000 crore given to MPs & MLAs annually for development works should be used as a corpus for State funding of elections,” Ramesh said.","“Hon’ble PM Modi - As an MP who represents a predominately rural constituency I fully support the 30 pc cut in my salary.

"Uttar Pradesh: Leadership rejig, thrust at block level on anvil","Representative Image

LUCKNOW: The high-stake UP assembly elections may still be two years away but the ruling BJP has started political spadework while gearing up to take on an assertive Opposition.Even as Ram temple construction in Ayodhya is likely to give much-needed traction to the saffron outfit, the party has decided to get back to drawing board to devise a fool-proof strategy at ground level and expand its footprint in rural areas.Inarguably ahead of its political rivals in poll preparations, BJP has already constituted divisional, district and booth level committees which will play a crucial role in steering party’s political prospects in the 2022 assembly election.The party is also set up for a shake-up in its state executive. According to sources, nearly 40% of the state leadership may undergo a change.“The party is driven by the principle of reaching out to the underprivileged. Both the Centre and UP government have been devising policies and schemes for the benefit of people. We will rely heavily on the benefits provided to people,” UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh said. BJP also plans to contest panchayat elections which are a reflection of political situation at ground level, essentially in rural areas. The party made a head start last week by forming a committee of senior leaders to supervise panchayat elections due later this year. Sources said the party would identify block level workers and assign responsibilities to them.The party will also identify blocks where its organisational machinery is relatively weak and needs refurbishment. The move comes amid the state unit of BJP raising the percentage of OBC, Dalit and women cadre from 7% to 42% in district committees.According to political experts, equations might have changed after the amended citizenship law with the Opposition seeking to raise BJP’s heckles by portraying it anti-Muslim and anti-Dalit.“Instructions have been issued to workers at grass roots level to reach out OBCs and Dalits and assure them that the citizenship law would not affect them,” a senior BJP leader said.The party’s minority wing is also trying to allay apprehensions among minorities.BJP is also considering bye-elections to Bangarmau, Bulandshahr, Tundla and Suar assembly seats as another testing ground to assess political situation.Experts said the BJP’s decision to field its candidates for the first time in teachers’ constituency legislative council seats was also driven by consideration to consolidate its position among educated masses.","According to sources, nearly 40% of the state leadership may undergo a change.“The party is driven by the principle of reaching out to the underprivileged.

Congress MLAs shouted, “Respect what the governor said just now.”With the exit of the governor from the House, Bhargava said that 22 Congress MLAs had sent their resignations on March 10. “The Kamal Nath government is in minority,” he said, and demanded a floor test. He reminded that the governor has instructed the government for a floor test.While Bhargava was speaking, speaker Prajapati carried on with the business of the House. Ruckus ensued and Bhargava continued to speak on the resignations of the Congress MLAs.Speaker Prajapati told the LoP, “Please sit down.

AAP govt doing politics over LG's order: BJP,"BJP spokesperson Meenakshi Lekhi said health infrastructure in the national capital has only worsened in last ... Read More

NEW DELHI: The BJP on Tuesday accused the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) dispensation of doing politics over the LG's decision to overrule its stand that Delhi government hospitals will be reserved only for city residents. BJP spokesperson Meenakshi Lekhi said health infrastructure in the national capital has only worsened in last over six-years of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal 's rule, and that his government does not work but indulges in blame game.""Delhi government has shown its incapacity to govern and uphold law. What it is doing is pure politics,"" the New Delhi MP told reporters. Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal on Monday overruled two controversial orders of the AAP government on reserving Delhi government-run and private hospitals in the national capital for Delhiites and allowing COVID-19 test of only symptomatic patients.The AAP reacted sharply to the LG's move, alleging that he had been pressured by the BJP which is doing ""dirty politics"" on the issue.Lekhi noted that the Delhi High Court had quashed a similar order, which said only Delhi domiciles will be treated in Delhi government hospitals, and said the AAP government made a similar decision despite being aware of the verdict.The Lieutenant Governor has taken the right decision by overruling the Delhi government.""Delhi government is indulging in charade to hide its incompetence. Lockdown period was supposed to create better infrastructure.

Spurt of political killings in UP's rural belt as panchayat polls draw close,"Prashant Kumar, Additional Director General (Law & order) , Uttar Pradesh

MEERUT: Amid hopes for the announcement of notification for elections to 59,076 village panchayats in Uttar Pradesh, which are due this year, there has been a spate of killings and murderous attacks in the rural belt of the state. With the term of village panchayats ending on December 15 and the state machinery needing at least six months to meet various formalities, there has been a steady rise in violent incidents in the already charged-up atmosphere in the state despite months of successive lockdowns at the time of coronavirus pandemic.On April 9, the gram pradhan of Chandauli district's Mehroda village was shot. Then on May 18, the pradhan of Palia village near Ayodhya , Jaiprakash Singh, was shot dead. On the same day, half a dozen men armed with country-made weapons attacked the kin of a local village pradhan in Baghpat, killing one on the spot and injuring two others. A day later, in Sambhal, a sitting village pradhan’s husband and his son were gunned down in the ongoing village rivalry. The sensational murder was even caught on the camera and the video had gone viral. On May 20, two brothers were killed in a Meerut village when clashes broke out between supporters of the former and sitting pradhans.On Saturday, a farmer was murdered when his political rivals equipped with firearms and swords attacked him in Bareilly region.This is not new. In the 2015 panchayat polls in the state, over a dozen lives were lost in the pre- and post-poll violence while many more were injured.UP police, however, doesn't segregate between general increase in crime and those linked with rural politics.“Political rivalries generally arise out of land disputes and prestige. So the line dividing crime due to political rivalries and other reasons often gets blurred. Hence, we cannot have a separate data of poll-related violence when the announcement of such election is still more than six months away. But, we are keeping a close watch on the incidents and have developed a multipronged strategy to mitigate this problem,” additional director general (law and order) Prashant Kumar said.Kumar added that the district administrations have been advised to fill up 19,500 vacancies of chowkidars and digital volunteers are being trained to ensure there is no flare-up due to the abuse of social media in poll-related rivalries in the rural parts.Over the years, the gram panchayat polls have been turned into a crude display of money and muscle, like other elections in the country.Officially, the UP State Election Commission has set a cap of Rs 75,000 in poll expenses for a gram pradhan candidate, apart from Rs 2,000 as security deposit and another Rs 300 for filing nomination. However, candidates backed by political parties spend a fortune to win these polls. According to one estimate, while candidates spend Rs 10 lakh on an average on their campaign, some of the wealthy ones are said to have spent in excess of Rs 50 lakh.Registered voters, who have left the villages to work in bigger cities, are brought back to the village on the polling day in buses hired by the candidates. Sometimes each candidate has to hire dozens of buses to ferry the voters.The panchayat polls are also important for the national parties because of the pradhan’s grip on these voters and his deemed ability to swing votes in favour of candidates in the assembly and general elections. According to a London School of Economics field study in UP’s Unnao district just before the 2012 assembly polls, the majority of voters in the rural parts did not even know the names of their MLA or MP. However, almost all of them knew their pradhans personally and trusted his opinion even in their personal matters.","Then on May 18, the pradhan of Palia village near Ayodhya , Jaiprakash Singh, was shot dead.

Politics infected by coronavirus: Madhya Pradesh CM,"Kamal Nath

Nath to Guv: The very edifice of democracy is in danger

BHOPAL: Chief minister Kamal Nath met Governor Lalji Tandon on Friday morning and demanded that Congress MLAs “imprisoned in Bengaluru” be freed. Accusing BJP of plotting an “unethical and illegal” conspiracy, Nath told reporters later that politics “has been infected by coronavirus”.At 11am on Friday, the CM’s convoy rolled into the Raj Bhavan compound, with him waving the victory sign to waiting mediapersons. During the hour-long meeting, Nath informed Tandon of the ongoing political upheaval in the state and submitted a memorandum, alleging “horse-trading of MLAs by BJP”.After leaving Raj Bhavan, CM Nath stepped out of his car to speak to mediapersons. Looking confident, he said: “I have met the Governor and greeted him on Holi. I gave him a letter on how Congress MLAs have been imprisoned, and demanded that all the legislators held captive in Bengaluru be freed and brought back to the state. The entire country has seen how Congress MLAs are being held hostage.” Asked about a possible floor test in the assembly, the CM said, “Floor test can be done after Governor’s address and budget. But that is only possible when MLAs are independent. You hold 22 MLAs captive and then ask for floor test, that is wrong. Let these MLAs come before the media and talk.”Replying to a question on spread of Coronavirus, CM Nath said, “Coronavirus is right now in the political situation here. politics “has been infected by Coronavirus.”In his letter to the Governor, the CM writes, “Our commitment to democratic process is unwavering. As a responsible leader of Indian National Congress, I invite and would welcome a floor test of my government in the forthcoming session of Madhya Pradesh assembly, already notified from 16th March 2020, on a date fixed by the Speaker. This is the minimum a Constitutional authority can offer to address the ongoing turmoil.”The CM leveled serious allegations at BJP. “I’m constrained to point out the immoral, unethical and illegal acts of BJP in Madhya Pradesh. In the first attempt, on 3rd/4th March 2020, the midnight drama leading to whisking away MLAs to Bangaluru is in public domain. Congress leaders foiled BJP’s attempt to keep in captivity the MLAs by using both allurement and force,” he wrote.“After the failure of the first attempt, BJP on 8th March 2020 arranged three chartered aircrafts to whisk away 19 MLAs of Congress to Bengaluru. Since then, these 19 MLAs, six of whom are cabinet ministers, are incommunicado in a resort arranged by BJP. Nobody is allowed access and /or any sort of communication with the 19 captive MLAs,” he has alleged.The CM expressed shock that senior leaders of BJP went to the Speaker’s residence and submitted resignations of the 19 MLAs. “This demonstrates the complicity of BJP leaders in the entire conspiracy and illegal action. It raises questions of Constitutional propriety and legislative procedure and transparency,” Nath points out.The CM also mentioned Thursday’s incident in Bengaluru when cabinet ministers Jitu Patwari and Lakhan Singh Yadav and Narayan Choudhary, father of an MLA Manoj Choudhary, were “manhandled” and arrested by police. Congress says Manoj wanted to return to Bhopal. “In these disturbing circumstances, the very edifice of democracy is in danger. Trust of a transparent democratic process seems lost. It merits full investigation and inquiry, so that persons responsible for de-railing the democratic institutional process are exposed and punished,” the letter said.","The entire country has seen how Congress MLAs are being held hostage.” Asked about a possible floor test in the assembly, the CM said, “Floor test can be done after Governor’s address and budget.

Delhi: Manish Sisodia accuses BJP of playing 'dirty politics',"Manish Sisodia

NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Monday alleged that lieutenant governor Anil Baijal was ""forced"" by BJP to overturn CM Arvind Kejriwal 's decision to reserve state-run and private hospitals for the residents of the national capital.

Accusing BJP of playing ""very dirty politics "", Sisodia said the Centre should've supported the decision taken by the elected government in the ""interest"" of the people of Delhi. ""Will you take responsibility if people of Delhi start dying for want of beds?"" a visibly angry Sisodia said in a video statement.

LG order is as per law, says BJP

Where will the residents of Delhi go if all beds are filled by patients from other states in the next 2-3 days?” He demanded that the LG revoke his order at the earliest.

“In the name of disaster management, it (BJP) is taking the city towards a disaster. When the Delhi government is working well in the health sector you are putting pressure on the LG to pass such orders. Shame on you!” Sisodia said, hours after Bajial issued directions that no patient is to be discriminated against for not being a resident of the capital.

The deputy CM said it was after due deliberations that the CM had taken the decision to reserve hospitals. He said that the CM had prepared a complete plan on how many beds were required to provide hospitalisation when Covid-19 positive cases reach a certain number. By overruling Kejriwal’s decision, the BJP-led Centre was trying to make the policies of the Delhi government unsuccessful, he said.

“BJP has forced the LG to overturn the Delhi cabinet’s decision by putting pressure on him. I want to ask BJP if it is working to face the corona challenge or playing politics,” Sisodia said.

He said at this time of crisis, there was a need for ""wise management"" decisions, not political management.

Leader of the opposition in Delhi assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, however, said that the LG had issued the order as per the law. He said that the high court has already said in an order in 2018 that preferential treatment cannot be given in health facilities.

“The Delhi government has failed to tackle the coronavirus crisis that’s why the AAP government is adopting these diversionary tactics. In a state where most cabinet ministers themselves are from outside Delhi such orders smack of a bias,” Bidhuri said. ""Where will the poor migrants who work here but have no documents go if they get infected?” he asked.

Pandemic impact: Political parties gear up for virtual rallies,"A file photo of CM BS Yediyurappa and governor Vajubhai Vala at an online meeting

BENGALURU: Political rallies as we know them are unlikely to return anytime soon, thanks to the pandemic. Union home minister Amit Shah ’s virtual rally on Sunday ahead of assembly elections in Bihar will be the new norm, what with social distancing norms in place. Political parties say they have no choice, but to bank on digital platforms to reach out to the masses.Karnataka BJP and Congress are already pulling out all the stops to connect with people by changing all scheduled campaign events into virtual ones.BJP has planned a virtual rally titled ‘Samartha Nayakatva - Samartha Bharatha’ on June 14. The party’s national general secretary (organization) BL Santosh, chief minister BS Yediyurappa and state party president Nalin Kumar Kateel will jointly address the audience.“We want to ensure at least one crore participants,” said AH Anand, BJP spokesperson. “We have already roped in 58 lakh subscriptions. The idea is to reach out to netizens to highlight the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Shah and Yediyurappa, especially in times of Covid-19.”Congress is also gearing up to go digital. The party plans to livestream the swearing-in ceremony of new president DK Shivakumar on various digital platforms. The event, dubbed ‘Prathijna Dina’ will also be held on June 14.“The government has put in place rules to tackle the pandemic, so we plan to connect party workers and leaders from gram panchayats and urban wards through Zoom app. It will be much bigger than BJP’s Bihar rally,” said Shivakumar. “About 10 lakh people are expected to attend.”Deputy CM CN Ashwath Narayan, who holds the information technology portfolio, said virtual political rallies cost next to nothing. “For A huge political rally, parties must spend huge money on hiring helicopters, chairs, flag makers, stage decorators, hotel stays, cars, buses and trucks, besides food, but for a virtual rally the party hardly needs to spend anything,” he said.Narayan said if the pandemic scare continues, the forthcoming gram panchayat elections will see a string of virtual rallies . However, experts say connectivity will play a key role and parties may struggle to reach out to voters in remote villages.","A file photo of CM BS Yediyurappa and governor Vajubhai Vala at an online meetingBENGALURU: Political rallies as we know them are unlikely to return anytime soon, thanks to the pandemic.

Congress playing cheap politics during pandemic: Satish Mahana,"GORAKHPUR: Industrial development minister Satish Mahana slammed Congress party accusing it of playing cheap politics even in the time of global pandemic.Addressing a press conference through video conferencing, he said, “Congress party is playing cheap politics even during pandemic as it is in the clutches of one family. Rahul Gandhi makes statements but is not able to explain them and later the entire party explains the meaning.”“Congress ruled the country for decades and always showcased the poverty in country. When Britain’s PM came to India, they took him to a hut to show poverty in India, while PM Narendra Modi showcases the country’s youth as its strength and as a result the nation’s fame and strength has increased under his guidance,” Mahana added.Due to right decisions of PM Modi and CM Yogi, Covid-19 is comparatively controlled in our country, he said.“PM Modi restored the faith of people, hence they gave a huge mandate. They know PM Modi does what he says. He abrogated Article 370 and gave reply to those who alleged that BJP only talks of temple and never gives a date. The government is also tackling terrorism effectively,” he said.“Yogi was the first CM to assist migrant labourers return to the state during lockdown and helped them reach home. Now, the CM is providing jobs to migrants. We are mapping the skills of migrants so that jobs could be provided to them. Before lockdown, less than one lakh people were working in MNREGS but now more than 41 lakh people are working,” the minister said.“Government is making all efforts to attract more and more industrialists.

"In Haryana, BJP keeping politics above public health, says Deepender","Rohtak: Reacting to the decision of BJP government in Haryana to hold rallies, Congress Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Hooda on Sunday said the saffron regime was keeping politics above public health.

Hooda said the number of COVID-19 cases were increasing by 200-300 daily. He said it was time for BJP to correct its priorities by saving lives, instead of starting a political campaign to advertise its achievements on the completion of PM Narendra Modi government’s one year at the Centre.

Reminding the state government of norms set by the Union ministry of home affairs, he said the central government had banned all political and social gatherings, seminars and meetings in which there was a possibility of a crowd coming together.

“There is a ban on a gathering of more than 50 people at a wedding ceremony too,” he said.

Even in case of a death, not more than 20 people can gather. “But the BJP wants to celebrate by gathering hundreds of people for mere political praise,” he said.

Hooda said the BJP party had announced to hold rallies in the state from June 14 to 17. “If there are any achievements, people would know about them. There seems to be no reason to assemble such a big number of people as it can spread infection,” he added.

BJP state president Subhash Barala had recently told the media that party leaders would distribute 10 lakh face covers and 10 lakh sanitiser bottles among people during the drive.

Sonu Sood enacting a political script: Sena on helping migrants,"MUMBAI: Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Sunday wondered whether the BJP propped up Bollywood actor Sonu Sood to ""offer help"" to migrant workers from north India stranded in Maharashtra amidst the lockdown, with the political motive to show the Uddhav Thackeray government in poor light.In his weekly column 'Rokhthok' in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana', Raut questionned the sudden rise of ""Mahatma"" Sood on the social scene of Maharashtra during the lockdown.Raut also referred to a ""sting operation"" against Sood ahead of the 2019 general elections, saying he had agreed to promote the BJP-led government at various platforms through his official social media accounts.The Sena's attack came against the backdrop of reports that Sood had arranged buses for migrant workers stuck in Mumbai.""Sood is an actor whose profession is to deliver dialogues scripted by someone else and make a living out of it. There are many people like Sood who would promote any political party if paid well,"" Raut said.He said no wise man would believe in Sood suddenly developing sympathy for labourers and sending them back in large numbers.Raut, who is the chief whip of the Sena in Parliament and executive editor of 'Saamana', said, ""the BJP has (politically) adopted Sonu Sood and tried to create an influence among the North Indian migrant workers"".During the coronavirus crisis, the BJP was struggling to stay politically relevant but faced a severe backlash from people as they did not like frequent criticism of the Thackeray government by leaders of the BJP, he stated.""The plight of migrant workers also turned many people against the Modi government for its handling of the coronavirus crisis,"" Raut stated.He said it was necessary to find out whether the BJP put a mask of a social worker on Sonu Sood and used him to further its political designs.""There is a person called Shankar Pawar, who is the head of Rashtriya Banjara Seva Sangh and seen frequently standing behind Sood in various photographs. He has the huge system and network to send people home,"" Raut said.Raut strongly defended the state government, which also comprises the NCP and the Congress, over its handling of the migrant crisis.""No other state could have treated migrant workers the way they have been taken care of by the Maharashtra government,"" he stated.The government has set up a special unit to streamline the process to transport migrant workers to their native states.""However, to show the state government's work in poor light, Sood has been deliberately promoted. 'If anyone wants to go home, please contact me' was the appeal of the actor,"" Raut wrote.The senior Sena leader also claimed that Sood had even received an invitation from Maharashtra governor B S Koshyari to laud his work.""Maharashtra chief secretary Ajoy Mehta should send a detailed list of people and organisations who served relentlessly and selflessly during the coronavirus crisis. Unfortunately, they do not have any political backing to promote their work,"" Raut said.In a swipe at the BJP, Raut said that people might soon here Sood's name in 'Mann Ki Baat' radio programme and him meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi.""Sood might even visit Bihar , Uttar Pradesh, Delhi as a star campaigner for the BJP. When most of the actors were sitting at home, Sonu Sood's acting skills were flourishing,"" he stated.You do not need a screen all the time to show your acting skills as has been demonstrated by ""Mahatma Sood"", Raut said.""Sood's political directors are experts in their field.

Political row over spraying disinfectant at Jaripatka slum,"Nagpur: A political row erupted over Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) drive to spray disinfectant at Kasturba Nagar slum, Jaripatka, on Monday. Congress city secretary Rohit Yadav, a resident of Kasturba Nagar slum, was booked by the Jaripatka police for obstructing NMC workers engaged in spraying disinfectant in the area.

A police complaint was lodged by BJP corporators from the ward, Virendra Kukreja and Mahendra Dhanvijay, and NMC health department.

Senior PI of Jaripatka Khushal Tijare told TOI, “Offence has been registered against Yadav under section 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public duty, section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and section 3 of The Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act. He came to police station and we served intimation notice to him. He will have to appear in court,” he said.

Yadav told TOI, “There is panic in Kasturba Nagar having around 300 houses after positive patients of Covid-19 were detected in Jaripatka. But disinfectant was being sprayed only in Sindhi Colony, Jaripatka. I started spraying disinfectant on Monday morning with a machine provided by Congress city president Vikas Thakre on my request. I noticed that a few NMC workers were spraying only water in our area. The workers too admitted this. NMC should not cheat people,” he said.

The Congress secretary stated that he didn’t mean to obstruct any NMC work. “I emptied the tank used by the workers only to show people that it had only water. I made a mistake in not informing the police and handing over the workers,” he said.

In a video that became viral on social media, Yadav can be seen spraying some milk coloured liquid from his machine. He is also seen spraying from the NMC worker’s tank. The liquid in this tank appears like normal water in the video.

NMC deputy commissioner Dr Pradeep Dasarwar said, “NMC is spraying sodium hypochlorite across the city. Manual spraying is being done in areas where positive patients were found. Fire tenders are being used for main roads and other parts of the city,” he said.

Kukreja said, “It is unfortunate that some people are trying to play politics despite the serious situation. Mayor Sandip Joshi has ordered spraying of disinfectant after positive patients were found in Jaripatka. The NMC has initiated all measures to control Covid-19,” he said.

The NMC is also spraying disinfectant in the housing society at central Nagpur where one positive case was detected on Sunday.

Political egos should be kept aside: Sena on varsity exams row,"MUMBAI: Amid the confrontation between Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and the state government over the issue of final year university exams, the Shiv Sena on Thursday said political egos should be kept aside at a time when the country is facing the Covid-19 crisis.Taking aim at leaders of the opposition BJP in the state a day after a cyclone hit Maharashtra, an editorial in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' said Koshyari should be cautious of the ""mad storm"" hitting the Raj Bhavan gates frequently.Koshyari on Tuesday criticised the Uddhav Thackeray- led state government's decision to cancel the final year university examinations on account of coronavirus outbreak, and said the decision would jeopardise the future of students.He also asserted that the chancellor of universities -- a position which governor holds ex-officio -- has the final authority over all university matters, as per the Maharashtra Public Universities Act.Noting that there has been a public display of differences between the government and the governor over the issue of final year university examinations, the Sena on Thursday said, ""Political egos and oneupmanship should be kept aside in times of crisis.""""The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented situation in the state and the country. The 'Sword of Damocles' is hanging over the future of a generation. Should their lives be endangered or should a consensus decision be taken on clearing the confusion over exams?"" the Sena asked.It said the government's decision to cancel the final year exams and give marksas per the aggregate of last semester was ""welcomed by all"".""But, opposition leaders immediately met the governor to register their protest and objected to the decision. The governor immediately wrote to the government and said examinations will be held according to the Universities Act,"" the Marathi daily pointed out.""We trust the governor's intellect, but some mad storm frequently hits the Raj Bhavan gates. The governor is a fine gentleman and he should be cautious of such storms, otherwise the future of lakhs of students will be at stake,"" it said.The governor is of the view that he, as chancellor of all universities, should have been taken into confidence. But it has been widely reported that state higher and technical education minister Uday Samant had met the governor in this regard,"" it pointed out.The Sena asked whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi had taken RBI governor and Union finance minister into confidence while announcing demonetisation, or the President while announcing the lockdown to contain spread of COVID-19.""We believe the Modi government has the mandate to take decisions. It is constitutionally illegal for the governor to bless the opposition's moves to oppose all decisions of the government,"" it said.Such ""tactics"" of the opposition will not destabilise the three-party Maha Vikas Aghadi government (comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress) in the state, it said.""Union Home Minister Amit Shah has himself said the government will collapse only if the three-party alliance breaks. Hence, the opposition party must come out of the illusion that the government will become unstable if it continues to oppose everything what the government does,"" the Shiv Sena said.The governor is the chancellor of universities and he is entitled to havehis views.""Butin the wake of thecoronavirus spread, how can examinations be held, endangering lives of 10 lakh students? The stand taken by the government is practical,"" it said.On concerns raised BJP leader Ashish Shelar over the issue of exams, the Sena said the government, after discussing with vice chancellors and education experts, will take a decision on how to give aggregate marksto the ATKT (allowed to kep term) students.ATKT is a process to allow students of pre-graduation and graduation to study in the next grade if they have failed in one to four subjects.On Shelar's reported remark that whether students passing on aggregate marks will be called ""corona graduates"", the Sena said there are ""several big people inpolitics with bogus degrees"".""Bogus degrees are dangerous than corona degrees,"" it quipped.On the governor'sstand that examinations will be held as per the Universities Act, the Sena said laws are applicable not just for universities but other areas also.""If laws had been followed, an illegal swearing-in wouldn't have taken place by lifting the President's rule whenpeople were still asleep,"" the Sena said.It was referring to the hush hush early morning ceremony held at Raj Bhavan after the state Assembly polls last year, when BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis was sworn in as chief minister after the Shiv Sena parted ways with the BJP over the issue of sharing the chief ministerial post.","""""The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented situation in the state and the country.

Quota back in Tamil Nadu politics as BCs denied medical seats,"Representative image

CHENNAI: Time-tested quota politics has returned to centre stage in Tamil Nadu, with the state government moving the Supreme Court for a direction to the Centre to implement 50% reservation for BC candidates in medical courses. It has come days after the DMK, CPM and other parties moved the Supreme Court over same issue of apparent denial of about 10,000 All India Quota (AIQ) medical seats in UG, PG and diploma medical and dental courses for BC candidates in four years.

States surrender 50% of their PG medical seats and 15% of their MBBS seats to the All India Quota pool every year. They are to be filled on the basis of reservation norms in vogue.

However, in its present petition, Tamil Nadu has alleged that AIQ seats surrendered by Tamil Nadu government for the benefit of OBCs, were being filled with open category candidates and that it is unconstitutional.

It is alleged that the Centre follows neither the Tamil Nadu law that provides for 50% reservation for OBC candidates, nor follows its own 27% reservation for such candidates. In fact, the Centre allotted only 17.61% of total seats for OBC candidates from out of seats under All India Quota last academic year, it said. The rule of reservation in respect of OBC candidates was not adhered to and, instead, the AIQ seats were filled with general candidates picked from open category.

""The right of the people of Tamil Nadu to have fair education has been violated by the Union government. Further, Tamil Nadu's right under Constitution is being violated by the Union government,"" the petition said. It said the action of the Centre violated Tamil Nadu Backward Classes, SC and ST Act, 1994, that outlines the state's 69% quota.

The National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) has always been controversial and politically touchy since its inception four academic years ago. On record, the ruling AIADMK government continues to maintain that it will protect the interests of government school students. Taking flak for poor enrolment of government school students in medical courses, it even holds crash courses for MBBS-aspirants from government schools.

The state's opposition parties that took up the issue first, are in no mood to give up the quota plank. ""We are for the socially backward sections that are denied and deprived of their due share in education and employment. The state had seen how the Justice Party passed an order to cancel the recognition of a school if a child belonging to SC is not given admission,"" said DMK's Rajya Sabha member TKS Elangovan.

It was former chief minister M Karunanidhi who enhanced the quota of SCs to 18% and BCs to 31%. His successor M G Ramachandran took the BC quota to 50%, but he had to withdraw economic criterion introduced by him. After vehement protests from the opposition, he had to withdraw his controversial order fixing 9,000 annual income as ceiling for BCs reservation benefits.

Vijay Rupani

GANDHINAGAR: Chief minister Vijay Rupani has said that the Gujarat Poshan Abhiyan should be made a peoples' movement to ensure that not a single child in 'anganwadis' of the state remains malnourished by the next Republic Day on January 26, 2021.

Rupani said there will be a third-party inspection to decide the best performing anganwadi and Asha workers.

He said the movement against malnutrition should be taken up with the same vigour and enthusiasm as two other programmes - Shala Praveshotsav for enrolment in schools and Kanya Kelavani for girls education. Both these programmes have been successful because of peoples' participation, he added.

There are 35.62 lakh children in the 0 to 6 age group in over 53,000 anganwadis in the state. Coining the slogan ""Ek Paalak, Ek Baalak"", Rupani urged voluntary organizations and individuals to voluntarily take up the responsibility as a 'foster parent' of the most malnourished children in anganwadis.

Shiv Sena MP heads panel to lobby with Centre,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Arvind Sawant

MUMBAI: A co-ordination committee of MPs across all parties in the state will be formed under chairmanship of Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant to press for state-related issues with the Centre. The decision was taken at a meeting of all MPs from the state called by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray ahead of the Union budget session. NCP chief Sharad Pawar too attended the meeting.

Pending matters related to the Maharashtra-Karnataka border dispute and payment of outstanding funds that Government of India was to allocate under various schemes were discussed.

NCP MP from Baramati Supriya Sule said the discussion related to funds held up with the Centre which was affecting projects. ""The state is supposed to get atleast Rs 15,000 crore from the Centre towards GST disbursements. The Centre had promised to give relief to the flood-affected people of western Maharashtra last year, but nothing has come so far. The co-ordination committee which was recommended by Mr Pawar was unanimously agreed to by everyone,"" Sule told TOI.

Another issue discussed was the Rs.3,290 crore grant given by the state to local bodies to compensate for the abolition of Local Body Tax which was subsumed under GST. The panel is likely to lobby the Centre to reimburse the state for it.

A proposal for rehabilitation and rejuvenation of 21 rivers in Maharashtra for which Rs. 3810.66 crore will be required was also submitted to the NITI AAYOG, which is also pending.

"Amid protests, Pentagon squirms under pressure to do Trump's political bidding","WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump wants the US military to take the lead in stopping violent race protests, making the Pentagon increasingly vulnerable to accusations of being a tool for his political goals.

Trump put the issue out in front Monday in a made-for-TV show of force.

After having police fire tear gas to clear away peaceful protestors in front of the White House, he walked with Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs Chairman General Mark Milley at his side to a nearby church to pose for pictures.

Minutes earlier, he had declared that he was dispatching ""thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers"" to help quell unrest, which appeared to invoke the rarely used Insurrection Act to involve the US Army in domestic peace-keeping.

The Pentagon stressed that the Insurrection Act had not been activated.

But Trump's words, and the picture of Milley in his camouflage battle dress at the White House, left many nervous.

Likewise did Esper telling governors of US states earlier Monday that they should ""dominate the battlespace"" to end the protests, sounding like he too viewed the situation as war.

One week after the killing of handcuffed African American George Floyd by a Minneapolis policeman sparked protests and riots for racial justice across the country, such talk sparked anger and concerns that Trump would use the military against political foes, and to boost his own stature.

""America is not a battleground. Our fellow citizens are not the enemy,"" said retired General Martin Dempsey, who held Milley's job from 2011 to 2105.

""I am not convinced that the conditions on our streets, as bad as they are, have risen to the level that justifies a heavy reliance on military troops,"" Mike Mullen , Dempsey's predecessor as the top Pentagon commander, wrote in the Atlantic on Tuesday.

""Furthermore, I am deeply worried that as they execute their orders, the members of our military will be co-opted for political purposes.""

The Pentagon sought Tuesday to dampen the concerns, even as hundreds of army policemen were placed on standby for duty if violence continued in the US capital.

A senior official, speaking on grounds of anonymity, insisted that Esper's ""battlespace"" was simply his habit of using the jargon of the US military.

""It's the common term we use for the area we are operating in,"" he said.

As for Milley's and Esper's presence when Trump made his political display, the official claimed they had been called to the White House at short notice -- hence Milley's camouflage uniform -- and did not know it was going to happen.

""The president indicated an interest in viewing the troops outside and the secretary and the chairman went with him,"" the official said.

""They were not aware that the police and law enforcement had made a decision to clear the square.""

That failed to douse concerns that the two top military leaders were being sucked and pressured into Trump's political plans.

""I remain gravely concerned about the President Trump's seemingly autocratic rule and how it affects the judgement of our military leadership,"" said the chair of the House Armed Services Committee, Adam Smith.

""The role of the US military in domestic US law enforcement is limited by law,"" he added.

""It must not be used in violation of those limits and I see little evidence that President Trump understands this fundamental premise.""

Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate for president, accused Trump of ""using the American military against the American people.""

It was clear, too, that African Americans in the US military had their focus on brutality toward blacks and less so on Trump's machinations.

""Just like most of the Black Airmen and so many others in our ranks ... I am outraged at watching another Black man die on television before our very eyes,"" tweeted Chief Master Sergeant Kaleth Wright, the senior-most enlisted man in the US Air Force.

Bihar: Political parties expect fresh schedule for council election,"Image used for representational purpose only

PATNA: With the Election Commission (EC) announcing fresh schedule for the deferred Rajya Sabha polls in seven states on Monday, political parties and officials in Bihar expect the announcement of dates for the deferred biennial polls of Bihar legislative council within the next few days.

“We hope the dates for the biennial elections to the state council will be announced in a day or two. The announcement of schedule for the deferred Rajya Sabha elections has made it clear that the EC has now begun the process to hold all deferred polls,” an assembly official familiar with the process of council polls told TOI.

“We expect the EC will now pay attention to the Bihar legislative council’s biennial polls, which could not be held on time due to the nationwide lockdown,” JD(U) state general secretary (headquarters) Navin Kumar Arya said.

Around three months ahead of the assembly election due in October-November, Bihar is all set to witness an electoral semi-final if the council elections are held in June-July. Altogether 29 seats in the 75-member legislative council are vacant.

Of them, 12 will be filled up through nomination by the governor on the state government’s advice, while the rest 17 will be filled up through biennial elections from different constituencies , including four each from the graduates and teachers’ constituencies and the rest nine from the Vidhan Sabha constituency.

The four graduates’ constituencies are Patna, Tirhut, Darbhanga and Kosi. These seats fell vacant after Neeraj Kumar (JD-U), Devesh Chandra Thakur (Independent), Dilip Kumar Choudhary (JD-U) and N K Yadav ( BJP ) completed their terms on May 6. Similarly, Patna, Tirhut, Darbhanga and Saran teachers’ constituencies fell vacant after the retirement of Nawal Kishore Yadav (BJP), Sanjay Kumar Singh (CPI), Madan Mohan Jha (Congress) and Kedar Nath Pandey (CPI), respectively, on May 6.

Besides these, the nine seats of Vidhan Sabha constituency also fell vacant after the members completed their six years term on May 6. “Dulha (groom) is ready. Band party and baraat are also ready. Now, the EC has to announce a ‘shubh muhurat’ (auspicious dates) for the council polls,” said Dilip Kumar Choudhary, who completed his term as MLC from Darbhanga graduates’ constituency.

The Akali Dal, which calls itself champion of the rights of states, today is not only silent on the action of the Union government for the sake of preserving the political office ,” the statement read."
Prashant Kishor: The gladiator of Indian politics does it again,"(This story originally appeared in on Jan 30, 2020)

New Delhi: Election strategist' Prashant Kishor and retired diplomat Pavan Varma , who were expelled from JDU, seemed to have failed to understand the fundamentals of their party chief Nitish Kumar . It was no accident that a once leader of Kurmis — who make just 3% in caste-riven Bihar — managed to become a five-time chief minister. Kumar’s political gymnastics has been so breathtaking that even Nadia Comaneci would feel envious. His crafty alliance-making has ensured that he lost only the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and the 1995 Bihar assembly elections miserably.Observers recall how he has outwitted several high-profile politicians, every time he found them a hindrance to his scheme of things. Kishor’s and Varma’s expulsion is, hence, no surprise. For the record, Kumar was 'Kush' to RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s 'Luv' in their hey days in the Janata Dal, only to part ways and turn his arch-rival by mid-90s. He got together with Prasad, two decades later, as co-architect of Bihar’s grand alliance in 2015 to stop BJP’s grand march, only to dump him and go back to BJP, months after the huge electoral win.Kumar’s 'Acharya' George Fernandes, his ‘Adhyakshji’ Sharad Yadav, his personal friend and costrategist in the fledging Samata Party, Shambu Shrivastav, his Samajwadi fellow traveler, the late Digvijay Singh, and his recent social ally Upendra Kushwaha have all been at the receiving end. Kumar’ only misstep was when he dumped BJP in 2013 over selection of Narendra Modi . However, he wasted no time to return and take Modi’s help to remain Bihar chief minister after he dumped RJD in 2016.Kishor’s and Varma’s ‘execution’ by gladiatorial Kumar was just a matter of time once they harped against CAA-NRC. Through their expulsion, Kumar has also made public his reading of the trend in poll-bound Bihar and his decision to stay firm with BJP by hitching his OBC-EBC base to BJP’s upper caste base to counter the Yadav-Muslim base of the opposition. Kumar may have also sensed that his vice president was carrying out a proxy war for Trinamool and AAP against BJP. By expelling Kishor, Kumar advertised his dispensability apart from planting seeds of suspicions in clients Trinamool and AAP by projecting him as an ‘Amit Shah recommended recruit’.Given that Kumar had once admitted BJP’s Sanjay Jha, one of his current ministers, into JDU, it’s not difficult to believe that Kishor was similarly 'accommodated' as part of a working arrangement. It is also known that a Rajya Sabha seat for Varma was Kumar’s way of appreciating the support the then high commissioner to Bhutan provided to the CM when he sought a hydel power pact with the kingdom. Kishor’s professional preference for Trinamool and AAP in fighting JDU’s ally only exacerbated his expulsion. It is no secret that Varma’s angst over CAA-NRC coincided with his failure to get a Rajya Sabha renomination. While trying his luck with AAP and Trinamool, Kishor may market himself as anti-BJP warrior on social media and explore poll-time recruitment to another party. Varma too may look for similar accommodation while busying himself with professional assignments.","It was no accident that a once leader of Kurmis — who make just 3% in caste-riven Bihar — managed to become a five-time chief minister.

"Conclude Babri trial swiftly, end communal politics: Iqbal Ansari","Iqbal Ansari

AYODHYA: One of the key litigants in the Ayodhya title suit, Iqbal Ansari has demanded swift disposal of the ongoing Babri Masjid demolition case in the special CBI court in Lucknow for the greater cause of communal harmony. His views were echoed by other litigants from the Muslim side in the now settled Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri title dispute — Mohammad Umar, Haji Mehboob and Khaliq Ahmad Khan.

Talking to TOI, Ansari said, “In the same way as Supreme Court set up a speedy trial to dispose the nearly seven-decade old Ayodhya title suit, the CBI court must also conclude the mosque demolition trial swiftly to end communal politics over the issue. After the apex court verdict in the Ramjanmabhoomi case last year, there should be no room for dispute between Hindus and Muslims anymore,” said Ansari.

Khaliq Ahmad Khan, a former litigant in the title suit, said, “Even Supreme Court had mentioned in its Ayodhya verdict that demolition of the Babri mosque was a crime and has now asked CBI court to pronounce its judgment by August 31 to put an end to the issue forever.”

Two other former litigants Mohammad Umar and Haji Mehboob also told TOI they were of the opinion that the protracted trial in the Babri demolition case must conclude at the earliest and punishment awarded to the accused.

US protests over Minneapolis death rage on amid political finger-pointing,"Protests over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody Monday, broke out in Minneapol... Read More

MINNEAPOLIS: The full Minnesota National Guard was activated for the first time since World War Two after four nights of civil unrest that has spread to other U.S. cities following the death of a black man shown on video gasping for breath as a white Minneapolis policeman knelt on his neck.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said the deployment was necessary because outside agitators were using protests over Monday's death of George Floyd to sow chaos and that he expected Saturday night's demonstrations to be the fiercest so far.

From Minneapolis to several other major cities including New York, Atlanta and Washington , protesters clashed with police late on Friday in a rising tide of anger over the treatment of minorities by law enforcement.

""We are under assault,"" Walz, a first-term governor elected from Minnesota's Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, told a briefing on Saturday. ""Order needs to be restored. ... We will use our full strength of goodness and righteousness to make sure this ends.""

He said he believed a ""tightly controlled"" group of outsiders, including white supremacists and drug cartel members, were instigating some of the violence in Minnesota's largest city, but he did not give specific evidence of this when asked by reporters.

As many as 80% of those arrested were from outside the state, Walz said. But detention records show just eight non-Minnesota residents have been booked into the Hennepin County Jail since Tuesday, and it was unclear whether all of them were arrested in connection with the Minneapolis unrest.

The Republican Trump administration suggested civil disturbances were being orchestrated from the political left.

""In many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized and driven by anarchic and left extremist groups - far-left extremist groups ... many of whom travel from outside the state to promote violence,"" U.S. Attorney William Barr said in a statement.

In an extraordinary move, the Pentagon said it put military units on a four-hour alert to be ready if requested by Walz to help keep the peace.

Activists staged another round of protests on Saturday in at least a dozen major U.S. cities coast to coast, including Seattle, Los Angeles, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Atlanta, New York and Atlanta.

In the nation's capital, hundreds of demonstrators assembled near the Justice Department headquarters, then marched toward the U.S. Capitol, chanting, ""Black lives matter,"" and ""I can't breathe,"" a rallying cry echoing Floyd's dying words.

Many later ended up near the White House , where they faced off with shield-carrying police, some mounted on horseback.

The streets of Minneapolis were largely quiet during daylight on Saturday, though several National Guard armored personnel carriers were seen rolling through town.

On Friday, in defiance of a newly imposed curfew, Minneapolis protesters took to the streets for a fourth night - albeit in smaller numbers than before - despite the announcement hours earlier of murder charges filed against Derek Chauvin, the policeman seen in video footage kneeling on Floyd's neck.

Three other officers fired from the police department with Chauvin on Tuesday are also under criminal investigation in the case, prosecutors said.

The video of Floyd's arrest - captured by an onlooker's cellphone as he repeatedly groaned, ""please, I can't breathe"" before becoming motionless - triggered an outpouring of rage that civil rights activists said has long simmered in Minneapolis and cities across the country over persistent racial bias in the U.S. criminal justice system.

'PAINS ME SO MUCH'

The mood was somber on Saturday in the Minneapolis neighborhood of Lyndale, where dozens of people surveyed damage while sweeping up broken glass and debris.

""It pains me so much,"" said Luke Kallstrom, 27, a financial analyst, standing in the threshold of a fire-gutted post office. ""This does not honor the man who was wrongfully taken away from us.""

Some of Friday's most chaotic scenes were in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, where police armed with batons and pepper spray made more than 200 arrests in sometimes violent clashes. Several officers were injured, police said.

In Washington, President Donald Trump said on Saturday that if protesters who gathered the night before in Lafayette Square, across from the White House, had breached the fence, ""they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.""

CHAOS IN ATLANTA

In Atlanta, Bernice King, the youngest daughter of slain civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr., urged people to go home on Friday night after more than 1,000 protesters marched to the state capitol and blocked traffic on an interstate highway.

The demonstration turned violent at points. Fires burned near the CNN Center, the network's headquarters, and windows were smashed at its lobby. Several vehicles were torched, including at least one police car.

Rapper Killer Mike, in an impassioned speech flanked by the city's mayor and police chief, also implored angry residents to stay indoors and to mobilize to win at the ballot box.

""But it is not time to burn down your own home.""

Floyd, a Houston native who had worked security for nightclubs, was arrested on suspicion of trying to pass counterfeit money at a store to buy cigarettes on Monday evening. Police said he was unarmed. An employee who called for help had told a police dispatcher that the suspect appeared to be intoxicated.

In a striking coincidence, Floyd and Chauvin had both worked security at the same Latin nightclub in Minneapolis, though it was unlikely they ever interacted, former owner Maya Santamaria, who sold the El Nuevo Rodeo club in January, told Reuters.

Santamaria said Floyd worked inside the club on certain nights, supporting other staff with security. She said Chauvin, who worked outside the club as an off-duty cop for 16 years, had a reputation for roughing up customers, but she considered him responsible and a friend.

Karnataka: BS Yediyurappa grandnephew's appointment as political secretary raises eyebrows,"NR Santosh

BENGALURU: Amid voices of dissent, chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Saturday appointed his former personal assistant and maternal grandnephew NR Santosh as his political secretary.

Santosh is the fourth political secretary to the CM besides SR Vishwanath, MP Renukacharya and Shankaranna Munavalli. Santosh was arrested for allegedly trying to kidnap Vinay NS, personal assistant of BJP leader KS Eshwarappa in 2017. He's also facing attempt to murder and dowry harassment charges.

The 30-year-old had fallen out with the CM's younger son BY Vijayendra soon after the BJP came to power and had been reportedly asked to keep away from him. He had identified with some MLAs who were up against the CM.

It's said the appointment was made to send out a message to the rivals after some MLAs launched a renewed campaign against Yediyurappa over a dinner meeting at BJP MLA Umesh V Katti's house. Though Yediyurappa was not keen, sources said Santosh brought pressure from RSS and some BJP leaders, whose help he had sought to reunite with the family. Santosh from Tumakuru is the son of the CM's sister's daughter. He was Yediyurappa's Man Friday and his job was confined to ensuring he took his medicines on time.

BJP set to technology-driven political activities ahead of Bihar polls,"PTI photo

NEW DELHI: On Narendra Modi completing the first year of his second term as PM, BJP has resumed political activities that had been at a standstill because of the lockdown forced by the coronavirus pandemic.Speaking at a media interaction , party chief J P Nadda on Saturday made it clear that the ruling BJP plans to use new technology in a big way, in the time of social distancing, to campaign and reach out to people essentially on how the Modi government tackled the situation on the ground, arising out of the spread of the deadly virus, to provide health and economic security to save the lives people in the country.Indicating that the party is fully prepared for state elections starting with Bihar — slated for later this year — Nadda said, “BJP workers will take the letter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to 10 crore families in the coming days by using different means of technology and the party will also hold several press conferences, 250 public meetings and 500 rallies for financially and socially weaker sections, women and farmers.” Modi has written an open letter to citizens on the work done and responsibilities of his government. The BJP chief held a video conference to address the media.He said the coronavirus pandemic will have a major impact on political activities, which is likely to be felt during the upcoming assembly elections in Bihar.The spread of the virus and return of a good number of migrant labourers to their home state, suffering without money and without much hope for employment opportunities in the near future are certainly going to be the most important issue to be addressed by BJP, which is part of the coalition government in Bihar with JD(U).The slugfest between the Centre and states with non-BJP government over management of the pandemic is likely to intensify as elections get closer.Banking on the measures taken to ease the people’s woes during the pandemic, Nadda said, “We have seen that this government is responsive, receptive and has the capacity to take bold decisions. This has been a year of accomplishments and we have also faced unimaginable challenges.

Kerala joins political blame game over running of Shramik Special trains,"NEW DELHI: Political blame game over Shramik Special trains continued between railway minister Piyush Goyal and Maharashtra government for the third day on Tuesday. Kerala chief minister Pinayari Vijayan targeted Goyal for railways sending Shramik Special train to the states without any advance information, which may imperil the state’s containment strategy.

Vijayan said the matter has been brought to the notice of Prime Minister.

Earlier in the day, Goyal accused Maharashtra government for its “inability” to bring passengers to railway stations. “Till 6 pm today (Tuesday), 85 out of total 145 trains were supposed to start from Maharashtra. But we could run only 27 trains as the state failed to arrange the passengers for running these trains,” the minister tweeted.

While Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray did not respond to Goyal, news agency ANI quoted Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik as saying, “Centre’s protocol to take permission from nodal officers of different states for movement of migrants was followed by us. Railway department was unable to fulfill the criteria of plying 150 trains daily. Piyush Goyal is trying to cover up railway department’s failure.”

Meanwhile, Vijayan also targeted railway ministry over sending a Shramik Special train without any advance information. “Indian Railways decided to send a train from Mumbai to Kerala. No information about it was passed to Kerala government. It was taken up with railway minister. We said that this would undermine measures taken by our government to ensure proper monitoring and control spread of Covid-19,” ANI quoted him as saying.

Vijayan said, “But then there was the issue of deciding to send another train in the same way from Delhi. Therefore, the matter has been brought to the notice of Prime Minister.”

NEW DELHI/SRINAGAR: National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah on Tuesday denied there were political reasons for his current visit to Delhi and dismissed as ""time pass for bored minds"" speculation that the party was divided on key issues.The former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister took to Twitter to refute suggestions that his visit was linked to reported moves for formation of an Advisory Council which may be headed by Altaf Bukhari , leader of the Centre-friendly Apni Party set up recently.His comments come in backdrop of perceived differences between two senior party leaders Tanvir Sadiq and Agha Ruhullah Mehdi over the events of August 5 last which saw virtual abrogation of Article 370 that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir.Omar maintained that the NC remained committed to challenging, ""using all lawful means"", what happened in August last year.Views of neither Sadiq nor Mehdi, ""expressed in a private capacity"", change the stand taken by party in the Supreme Court and outside regarding events of August 5, he said.A newspaper article by Sadiq, the political secretary to Omar when he was the chief minister, on the political roadmap ahead skipped any reference to Article 370 which prompted Mehdi, party's chief spokesman, to comment, ""This provokes a question in my mind. What is a political process for you? Only an election? If we go with a reason and stand our course, even being detained is a part of political process.""Omar, who arrived in Delhi on Monday for the first time since August 3 last year, said he was in the capital because ""I needed a change of scene and some medical follow up"".There was nothing political about the visit, said Omar, who was detained for nearly eight months from August 5.Describing Sadiq and Mehdi as ""valued colleagues and friends"", Omar said both were entitled ""to an opinion and to disagree with each other"".NC was a democratic party and ""we value all shades of opinion within our wider family though sometimes it is better to discuss them amongst ourselves before we decide to make them public"", the NC leader said.""I have burnt my hands a few times by not following my own advice,"" Omar wrote.In his article, Sadiq had called for the release of all political leaders including Mehbooba Mufti, Ali Muhammad Sagar and Shah Faesal, besides restoration of all means of communication. He had also called on the government to allow resumption of the political process.A Twitter war broke out between Sadiq and Mehdi, a former cabinet minister and an influential Shia leader from Budgam following which he removed party chief spokesperson designation from his Twitter handle bio on Tuesday.Mehdi, a three three-time legislator from Budgam assembly constituency of central Kashmir, said in a series of tweets that holding assembly elections in the Union territory should not be the only goal of mainstream politicians.""Many of my colleagues are detained under PSA. Others including me are put under house detention. My heart goes out to them and I wish and pray for their immediate release. But, believe me their and our (house) detention is a political message and process itself,"" Mehdi said.Sadiq, in an apparent reference to the former minister's criticism, said he does not need a certificate from anyone and it was easy to comment sitting with one's family and occasionally tweeting to show how brave they are.","Omar Abdullah (File photo)Finally I’m in Delhi for the 1st time since 3rd August 2019.
What is a political process for you?
If we go with a reason and stand our course, even being detained is a part of political process.

Illicit liquor manufacturing in Punjab: Investigations reveal heady mix of political cocktail,"Policemen inspect an illegal liquor manufacturinng unit in Shambhu area

PATIALA: The ongoing investigations into the illegal liquor manufacturing racket that was recently busted at Shambhu have revealed that those involved belong to different political parties and had joined hands to make some quick and hefty money by not only bypassing the local law enforcers but also the state excise department.

While some of these men are local leaders having affiliations with Congress, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and some have close links with the local BJP leaders including a former MLA of the saffron party. All of them are now being investigated by the cops for their involvement in the racket.

So far the police investigators have discovered a collaboration between Amrik Singh, sarpanch of Khanpur Village whose wife is a member Zila Parshad. Both are associated with the Congress party. Darshan, of Tabri Village, who is a SAD loyalist and had been a former member block Samiti. Vijay Kumar, who owns the cold store where the unit to manufacture illegal liquor had been set up, is a known aide of a former BJP legislator from Rajpura, while Dipesh, who is said to be the kingpin of the racket, is a Congress leader.

Sources in the police have revealed that these were all local leaders, who under the garb of their proximity with some established leaders of Congress, SAD and BJP, exploited the loopholes in the system, bribed the excise officials and managed to set up the illegal liquor manufacturing unit inside cold storage which was once owned by a former BJP legislator from Rajpura.

The police have so far prepared a list of persons frequently visiting the cold storage based on which further investigations are being conducted. Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh has already fixed the responsibility of the area deputy superintendent of police and the concerned SHO to make certain that such illegal activities are nipped in the bud.

Sources said so far it has come to light that a sum of Rs 5 lakh a month was paid to the local excise officials to look the other way while these men minted money. The extra neutral alcohol (ENA) which was used to manufacture the liquor of all established brands was ‘stolen’ from the tankers being sent out from various distilleries. The amount of liquid taken from these tankers was replaced by water to compensate for the pilferage.

It was learnt the ENA containing more than 70% alcohol was procured for Rs 50 to Rs 55 a litre and then diluted to 40% and after adding some flavours and colours the final product was bottled and sent for sale within and outside the state to mint money.

Patiala SSP Mandip Singh Sidhu said the police were investigating the case from various angles and the political affiliation of the accused were quite intriguing. He said the call and mobile records of a number of people were being scrutinised to ascertain if they were involved in this racket in any way. “We will book anyone who is found involved in the case,” he said,

Meanwhile, the rival political parties are targeting each over the issues. A former SAD legislator from Ghanour, Bibi Harpreet Kaur Mukhmailpur, said not only liquor but other illegal activities were also being run from the constituency at the behest of the Congres MLA Madan Lal Jalalpura, who denied the allegations and said, “ I do not have any association with the accused persons.”

Fingers have also been raised against Congress MLA from Rajpura Hardial Kamboj, who said he had always stood against any sort of illegal activity in his constituency. “Rivals are unnecessaries dragging me into this controversy. They need to be reminded that when some local miscreants in connivance with local police officials formed a nexus to sell drugs in my constituency, I vehemently raised the issue in the meeting of district grievance redressal committee and ensure that action is taken against them.”

He said BJP state president Bandi Sanjay lacks maturity and condemned him for commenting against KCR as anti-national. “Some states like Bihar also passed a resolution against NPR, are they also anti-national? Bihar’s CM is also an ally of BJP,” Prabhakar said.

He said KCR would undertake a national level campaign and movement against the CAA if required.

"Amit Shah, BS Yediyurappa to discuss cabinet berths on Bengaluru-Hubballi flight","This story is from January 18, 2020

(Left-right) BS Yediyurappa and Amit Shah

BENGALURU: Chief minister BS Yediyurappa will discuss cabinet expansion with BJP national president Amit Shah during a 45-minute flight from Bengaluru to Hubballi and, perhaps, again after the two attend a pro-Citizenship (Amendment) Act rally in the North Karnataka city.

Yediyurappa’s several efforts to meet Shah, and even Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to discuss plans to expand his cabinet over the past month were rebuffed, piling pressure on the CM, who has been assailed by MLAs for berths.

Shah, also Union home minister, is scheduled to arrive mid-day on Saturday in Bengaluru, and will preside at a rally at Palace Grounds in the afternoon along with Yediyurappa. The two will then travel together on an Air Force flight to Hubballi, where Shah is expected to stay the night at a star hotel after the pro-Citizenship (Amendment) Act rally.

“The meeting between Shah and the CM will possibly be in-flight from Bengaluru to Hubballi and/or later in the night at Hubballi,” said a BJP functionary.

Earlier on Friday, jittery aspirants for ministerial positions made a beeline to Yediyurappa’s residence, Davalagiri, in Bengaluru. Prominent among them were disqualified legislator MTB Nagaraj and former minister Umesh Katti.

The CM described Nagaraj’s visit as “only a courtesy” call and insisted he did not ask to be made a minister.

Nagaraj said: “One cannot demand any sort of ministerial berth as the CM is already under pressure. With so many aspirants, it is understandable the kind of pressure he is under. The final decision as to who will be made minister is left to the BJP central leadership and the chief minister.”

The former legislator continued to accuse BJP Chikkaballapura MP BN Bachchegowda and his son, Sharath — to whom he lost the Hoskote assembly seat in the bypolls — of antiparty activities.

Nagaraj said he again requested Yediyurappa to take action against the MP for backing his son, which resulted in his loss.

“All 17 of us [who quit the Congress and JD(S) and joined the BJP], who resigned from ministerial posts and the rest from their MLA seats, are the reason for the BJP being in power. I am sure the chief minister will take an appropriate decision,” he said.

Besides Nagaraj and Katti, legislator K Gopalaiah, who moved from JD(S) to BJP, also met the CM to impress upon him to swear-in the turncoats as ministers.

The government should conduct floor test, insists BJP

The number game

NEW DELHI: Madhya Pradesh governor Lalji Tandon on Monday issued a fresh directive to beleaguered chief minister Kamal Nath to hold a floor test in the assembly on Tuesday as a 'letter war' raged between the two constitutional functionaries amid political turmoil in the state.CM Kamal Nath met governor Lalji Tandon at Raj Bhavan on Monday night and later claimed his government enjoys majority, ruling out holding a floor test in the assembly.Nath also dared the opposition BJP to table a no-confidence motion against his 15-month-old Congress government if they wanted to test its strength in the House.I met the governor and thanked him for his address on the opening day of the budget session. We are in a majority today so no question of a floor test.Madhya Pradesh governor Lalji Tandon asked chief minister Kamal Nath to face floor test on Tuesday. The governor said failure to hold a floor test will mean the chief minister does not enjoy majority in the house.Tandon's fresh directive came two days after he first asked Nath to face a floor test on Monday, after commencement of budget session of the Assembly.Following the adjournment, the BJP filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking floor test in Madhya Pradesh assembly. Former Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and nine other BJP MLAs moved SC seeking a direction to assembly speaker to hold floor test within 12 hours.The Madhya Pradesh Assembly was adjourned till March 26 in view of the state government's concern over coronavirus even as the BJP raised the demand for holding of a floor test.After the Budget session began at 11 am, the governor began his customary address to the House which lasted barely two minutes, as he didn't read out the entire content and left with speaker NP Prajapati.Minister for parliamentary affairs Govind Singh raised the issue of coronavirus threat in the country and also mentioned an advisory issued by the Central government.Accepting Singh's demand, the speaker adjourned the proceedings till March 26, the day when voting for the Rajya Sabha elections will be held.The 22 MLAs of the Congress who had resigned might not return to Bhopal on Monday from Bengaluru where they are camping. Their rebellion from the Congress had triggered a political crisis in the state.These MLAs, including six ministers, have already resigned from the membership of the assembly and there is no point in coming back at this point, they said.Speaker NP Prajapati had accepted resignations of six of the 22 MLAs. He, however, remained non-committal on holding a floor test.Interestingly, the holding of a floor test found no mention in the List of Business (LoB) issued by the state Assembly secretariat on Sunday night.The LoB mentioned only about the Governor's customary address on the first day of the Budget session and the motion of thanks.BJP national vice president Shivraj Singh Chouhan said, ""Kamal Nath has very innocently said that it is the job of the speaker to conduct floor test, while the fact is that it is the government which decides the business of the House"".""The governor had ordered the chief minister to seek the trust vote after his customary address. Tandon has written the letter to you (Nath) and not to the Speaker,"" he told reporters on Sunday late night.Chouhan said that with the resignations of 22 MLAs, the Nath government was reduced to a minority.""The government must table a proposal for holding a floor test in the House and the speaker should ensure that it will be conducted,"" the former chief minister demanded.As of Sunday evening, the assembly strength is 222 — after six resignations and death of two MLAs — putting the majority mark at 112. If the 16 other resignations, in the wake of Scindia’s quitting Congress are accepted, Congress would be down to 92 members in the House, which would then have a strength of 206, putting the majority mark at 104.In Video: MP political crisis: BJP moves SC, seeks floor test","We are in a majority today so no question of a floor test.Madhya Pradesh governor Lalji Tandon asked chief minister Kamal Nath to face floor test on Tuesday.

Rahul Gandhi doing 'politics of misery' over migrants issue: BJP,"Congress leader Rahul Gandhi (File Photo)

NEW DELHI: The BJP on Saturday accused Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of doing ""politics of misery"" over the issue of migrants , claiming that his party did nothing to help them in states where it is in power.

The attack from the BJP on the former Congress president came on a day the opposition party released a documentary film on Rahul Gandhi's interaction with a group of migrant labourers last week.

""Gandhi family did nothing to do help migrants in states where they are in power. Migrant workers from UPA-ruled Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Maharashtra were not allowed even to return to their native villages,"" BJP spokesperson G V L Narasimha Rao said.

Rahul Gandhi has been ""indulging in camera politics"". He is visiting and speaking to migrants in non-Congress ruled state not with the intention of giving them relief but to indulge in politics of misery, he added.

The Rajya Sabha MP said Gandhi would have heard the woes of migrants in Rajasthan had he ventured there.

""Alas, Rahul is only interested in politics and not helping migrants. With the entire Gandhi family indulging in politics over migrants, the Congress party is seen by the public as a party fishing in troubled waters and not as a responsible party joining the national effort in mitigating distress of migrants,"" Rao said.

The Congress has been critical of the handling of migrants issue by the BJP-led central government.

Rahul Gandhi has demanded justice for such workers who are walking hundreds of kilometres to their homes amid the coronavirus lockdown. At the end of the documentary, Gandhi says the government should immediately give Rs 7,500 to the 13 crore needy families through direct cash transfer.

Political hara-kiri and the art of negotiation,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Tamil Nadu assembly election is more than a year away. In politics, a year is eternity as configurations can change within hours, if not days, making predictions difficult. It, however, is safe to make one forecast — that the victor would owe much to the vanquished. In other words, bickering in alliances will be a deciding factor in 2021; the less cohesive combine is more likely to lose.

As polls near, some political parties, like the Jatinga birds, get suicidal. The Congress displayed this tendency on January 10, when TNCC president K S Alagiri openly blamed the DMK for going against alliance dharma by not allotting the Congress enough posts of local body chiefs in the recently concluded panchayat polls — a just complaint which shouldn’t have been made in public. DMK’s angry man Durai Murugan said the Congress could leave the alliance if it was unhappy (which was not any less a hara-kiri tendency), but Alagiri came around to meet M K Stalin and defuse the situation.

Alliance members working at cross purpose was more evident in the AIADMK-led combine, where the BJP, PMK and DMDK candidates fought each other besides taking on some AIADMK candidates. PMK Tiruvallur district cadres took to the streets alleging foul play in the victory of the AIADMK candidate in Ellapuram panchayat union ward.

These rumblings wouldn’t have mattered if the fight was unequal. If the alliances remain as they are, the DMK-led side will not have a cakewalk as many of us thought when the AIADMK split after J Jayalalithaa’s death in 2016. Not only has the AIADMK been able to remain together, virtually neutralising T T V Dhinakaran, the party has also been able to bring together divergent parties as allies. It’s another matter that the combine could not stop the DMK alliance’s juggernaut that won 38 of the 39 seats in Tamil Nadu and the one in Puducherry.

The rainbow coalition, however, helped the AIADMK win just enough (nine of 22) assembly seats that had byelections. Again, winning the Vikravandi and Nanguneri bypolls in October 2019, the ruling party cemented its position at Fort St George till 2021. The challenge for the AIADMK side would be as much to keep the BJP happy as to balance the interests of such competing partners as the PMK and the DMDK, which are known to make impossible demands.

For Stalin and EPS, it will be a litmus test to preside over the seat-sharing exercise for assembly elections. Their predecessors — M Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa were masters of the art. While Jayalalithaa often took a ‘take it or leave it’ stand with her allies, Karunanidhi was a shrewder player of the apportioning game. “The art is,” once a DMK leader told me, quoting Karunanidhi, “to have the other guy have his say — and you have your way.”

Those at the negotiation table could take a leaf out of Karunanidhi’s book. In the 1971 simultaneous polls, he offered Indira Gandhi’s Congress seven Lok Sabha seats and 15 assembly seats. But Congress leaders M Bhaktavatsalam, C Subramaniam and Mohan Kumaramangalam bargained for 80 assembly seats. When the talks were stuck, the Congress did a fatal posturing, announcing its list. And Karunanidhi announced his.

That midnight, Indira Gandhi rang up Karunanidhi to ask for 20 assembly seats. He said he could give 10 LS seats, but no assembly seat. It was an offer Indira couldn’t refuse. It marked the lowest point of the Congress’s bargaining power in TN. Are you listening, Mr Alagiri?

More twists ahead in Madhya Pradesh political thriller?,"Congress workers perform a yagna to prevent horse trading

BHOPAL: Amid the political crisis confronting Kamal Nath government, ‘prevention is better than cure’ got a whole new meaning when health and finance minister Tarun Bhanot used the proverb in context of CoVID-19 on Saturday and hinted at a possible postponement of the make-or-break session of the assembly.The budget session is scheduled to start on March 16. Neighbouring Chhattisgarh has already extended the Holi vacation of assembly till March 26 and will take a call later on whether it can reconvene on that day.“Prevention is better than cure. Safety of all MP residents is paramount. It is not a political issue for us. We are seeking advice from our top health experts,” said Bhanot, who was given the health portfolio on Friday after Tulsi Silawat was removed from the cabinet by the Governor on the recommendation of CM Kamal Nath.To add to it, general administration department minister Dr Govind Singh said, “All those coming from CoVID-19-impacted locations should be tested.” The 22 breakaway Congress MLAs are in Bengaluru, where six CoVID-19 cases have been detected, one of whom has died. It’s likely that the rebel Congress MLAs would have to undergo screening and tests for Coronavirus as and when they return to Bhopal.The health department would be mandated to screen everyone before they enter Vidhan Sabha. Restriction on public gatherings came into force in MP on Saturday. Schools, colleges and cinemas are closed and CM Nath has ordered that any event where a large gathering is expected should be rescheduled.“So far, MP has not reported any CoVID-19 cases. We want to keep it that way. We are taking measures to keep our citizens safe. I was to ask BJP if they support the measures to keep MP residents healthy and safe,” Bhanot said.Health department’s principal secretary, Pallavi Jain Govil, held a press meet on Saturday to outline the safety and preventive measures being taken. A team of doctors will be deployed at Vidha Sabha, with respiratory masks and other equipment. Ambulances will be parked outside.On March 5, The Madhya Pradesh Public Health Act, 1949 was invoked in the state. Chief medical and health officers and civil surgeons of districts are vested with all authority to ensure control of CoVID outbreak under Public Health ACT 1949. It vests magistrate-like powers with health officers, whereby they can quarantine and lock down identified areas to prevent an outbreak.","Safety of all MP residents is paramount.

"Narottam Mishra is ace in Shivraj Singh Chouhan's Covid-cabinet, gets home and health","Narottam Mishra

BHOPAL: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Wednesday allocated portfolios among his five ‘covid cabinet’ colleagues, who were sworn in the previous day.

Narottam Mishra got both home and health, the two most crucial departments in the fight against coronavirus, reinforcing his clout in the new regime and state BJP.

Scindia loyalist Tulsi Silawat -- widely expected to get back his health department, if not more – was given water resources. Govind Singh Rajput, who had the prize portfolios of transport and revenue in the Kamal Nath government before breaking away from Congress along with the Scindia camp, has been allotted food and civil supplies and cooperatives.

BJP long-timer Kamal Patel, who is back in the political mainstream after quite some time, was assigned the key agriculture portfolio and Meena Singh has been given tribal welfare.

CM Chouhan said: “Departments have been allocated, as of now, keeping in mind the task of controlling coronavirus pandemic in the state. Once the cabinet is expanded, we shall have a look at portfolio allocation in its entirety and decide the issue in consultation with other leaders in the party.”

Wishing new ministers to tide over Covid crisis: Scindia

Asked for his reaction on the formation of the cabinet and portfolio allocation, Jyotiraditya Scindia told TOI: “I wish them all the best to resolve the crisis, which MP faces. They should be committed to the cause and do justice to the heavy responsibility that is on their shoulders. I am also available for whatever service I can render through Scindia Foundation, or whatever means.”

The allocation of water resources to Silawat came as a surprise to many. He was health minister in the Nath cabinet and the Congress government’s campaign against adulteration, named ‘Shudh Ke Liye Yudh’, had become synonymous with “Milawat Ke Khilaf Silawat”.

After he broke away from Congress with other Scindia loyalists and joined BJP, it was speculated that he might be made deputy chief minister along with Narottam Mishra. But, while Mishra walked away with the lion’s share in the portfolio allocation, Silawat had to be content with water resources.

On Tuesday, when the mini-cabinet was sworn – nearly a month after Chouhan took over as CM – each minister was given two divisions to monitor the fightback against coronavirus. It seemed that portfolio allocation would take place when the cabinet is expanded after the lockdown ends, but the CM recommended portfolios for the five ministers to Governor Lalji Tandon on Wednesday morning, who approved it.

"UP govt doing petty politics, says Sachin Pilot","Jaipur: Deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot on Friday accused the UP government of doing petty politics over the issue of buses for migrants, while transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas demanded that Yogi Adityanath be booked for allegedly defying the Centre’s orders on plying of vehicles.

Khachariyawas said the UP chief minister first gave clearance for entry of buses but later created “hurdles” by saying that permits of buses were not valid. The fitness of the buses was also questioned by the UP government.

He said the UP chief minister should be booked for allegedly defying the Union home ministry order which had said that documents such as licence, permit and fitness of vehicles will not be checked till June 30.

Speaking to reporters here, Pilot also slammed the Centre for not making any concrete nationwide policy for transportation of migrant workers. “Taking help doesn’t diminish someone’s stature. UP government did politics and blamed Congress. We condemn it. Congress had made arrangement of buses for the migrant workers when there was no help from the Centre,” Pilot said.

"Opposition disconnected from people, doing negative politics: Javadekar","Prakash Javadekar (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Accusing the opposition of ""double speak"", the BJP on Friday slammed it as well as Congress president Sonia Gandhi for their criticism of the Narendra Modi government over its handling of the coronavirus crisis, saying they have become ""disconnected"" from people and are ""speaking out of frustration"".Senior BJP leader and Union minister Prakash Javadekar alleged the opposition was doing negative politics when it should have projected a united face in combating Covid-19 ""The opposition is displaying negative politics. It is indulging in hypocrisy and double speak. These parties earlier asked why the lockdown was not being extended and now they are asking why you are doing so,"" he told reporters.Non-BJP ruled states like West Bengal first did not use Shramik trains as much as they should have and now the Congress is doing politics by sending very few buses, he said, in an apparent reference to the opposition party's proposal to send buses to Uttar Pradesh to ferry migrants.Hitting out at Sonia Gandhi for her criticism of the government's Rs 20 lakh crore economic package, Javadekar said the Centre had earlier given Rs 1.70 lakh crore cash to the poor and has also hiked the MNREGA budget to over Rs 1 lakh crore.""These parties have become disconnected with people and are speaking out of frustration. People are very much with Prime Minister Narendra Modi whose efforts to combat the coronavirus has drawn accolades from world leaders. The situation in India is much better for a country of its population,"" he said.BJP spokesperson G V L Narasimha Rao also hit back at the Congress after Sonia Gandhi slammed the government, claiming that it has abandoned any pretence of being democratic and forgotten the spirit of federalism.He accused the Congress of playing ""cynical"" politics over the Covid-19 crisis and said its president Sonia Gandhi and her ""family"" have ""indulged in drama"" at the time of a national catastrophe.The government's Rs 20 lakh crore package and its details have turned to be a ""cruel joke"" on the country, Sonia Gandhi said at a meeting of opposition parties.Hitting back, the BJP said it is the Congress president and her daughter Priyanka Gandhi Vadra who have ""played cruel jokes and cynical politics on migrant workers"".""They did nothing for migrant workers except the mother-daughter duo making some grand announcements. Except indulging in drama and petty politics at a time of national crisis, Sonia and her family did nothing to contribute to nation's united fight against the pandemic,"" Rao said in a statement.""Never before have a principal opposition party indulged in such cynical politics and the Congress will pay a political price for playing negative politics,"" the Rajya Sabha MP claimed.Congress-ruled state governments have shown utter lack of sensitivity towards the migrants and refused to allow their own citizens to use Shramik special trains, he alleged.""The whole world is appreciative of our handling of the Covid-19 crisis and the lockdown strategy in controlling the spread of the pandemic in India. Sonia Gandhi is perhaps regretting why India didn't turn out to be like her native Italy,"" Rao said.Only today, he noted, a study by the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) showed how India averted 20 lakh cases and up to 78,000 deaths by imposing the lockdown timely and implementing it effectively.Every relaxation, like inter-state travel of migrants on Shramik special trains or of bringing home Indians stranded abroad by Vande Bharat evacuation flights, has been allowed with elaborate Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), to be strictly followed by all state governments, Rao said.The strategy to exit the lockdown has been designed in a very thoughtful and systematic manner, he added.The BJP leader said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership in successfully controlling the Covid-19 challenge has been praised by world leaders.""The Gandhi family is unable to digest the fact that PM Modi has emerged as truly a global leader and his image has surpassed that of every leader from its dynasty,"" he claimed.Addressing a meeting of 22 opposition parties convened through video-conferencing to discuss the situation arising out of the coronavirus pandemic, Sonia Gandhi alleged that the government is uncertain about the criteria for enforcing lockdowns and has no exit strategy.","Prakash Javadekar (File photo)NEW DELHI: Accusing the opposition of ""double speak"", the BJP on Friday slammed it as well as Congress president Sonia Gandhi for their criticism of the Narendra Modi government over its handling of the coronavirus crisis, saying they have become ""disconnected"" from people and are ""speaking out of frustration"".Senior BJP leader and Union minister Prakash Javadekar alleged the opposition was doing negative politics when it should have projected a united face in combating Covid-19 ""The opposition is displaying negative politics.

BJP indulging in vendetta politics: Congress after FIR against Sonia Gandhi,"File photo

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Thursday accused the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of indulging in vendetta politics after a case was registerd in Karnataka against Sonia Gandhi for raising questions over the PM-CARES fund.The party also hit out at the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh, alleging that was it playing dirty politics by registering a case against the party's state unit chief Ajay Kumar Lallu and arresting him twice on Wednesday. The party also urged Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to review his decision.""It is extremely unfortunate that at a time like this, when the world is facing a disaster like coronavirus and where in India crores of people have lost their livelihood and are forced to walk home, instead of helping them and providing for them all that you (BJP) want to do is vendetta politics.""You are not just misusing government machinery, you are also inciting vendetta politics. We strongly condemn this,"" Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said at a press conference held through video conferencing.A case has been registered against Congress president Sonia Gandhi at Sagara town in Karnataka's Shivamogga district on a complaint that @INCIndia, the official Twitter handle of the Congress, tried to create distrust among the masses with its tweet by spreading ""baseless charges.""The complainant alleged that on May 11 at 6 pm, the INC India Twitter account posted messages against Prime Minister Narendra Modi alleging ""misuse"" of PM-CARES Fund set up to enable people contribute to help the government fight the coronavirus and ""similar distressing situations.""Shrinate said it was not just about the FIR against Sonia Gandhi, ""this gives us an insight into how the BJP and Mr Modi operates"".""Even at a time like this, what is important for them is vendetta politics. This is a democracy and in a democracy opposition leaders have a basic right to ask questions,"" she said.Shrinate said this was a not a question on the state of affairs, but on the PM-CARES Fund, where thousands of crores have been deposited and even with so much funds available why are migrants still forced to walk and why are people still suffering.""Why can this money not be released... every Indian wants to ask this question,"" she said.About about the arrest of Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu, Shrinate said, ""This is political vendetta. We request that you leave aside this politics, reconsider the allegations against Ajay Lallu ji and end this politics of vengeance.""The Uttar Pradesh Congress chief was arrested twice on Wednesday -- first in Agra for sitting on a dharna to protest against UP government not granting permission to allow buses arranged for migrants by the Congress enter the state.He was granted bail by an Agra court and released, before being rearrested by a team of Lucknow police in a second case filed here in connection with the Congress' standoff with the state government.""This is a murder of democracy. We strongly condemn the detention of Ajay Lallu ji. The Chief Minister should reconsider this. It seems that the BJP government is indifferent to the suffering of the people,"" Shrinate said.She said that ""dirty politics"" was being played even at the time of coronavirus pandemic. ""Not only did the Adityanath government rejected our offer of help with the buses, but even sent UP Congress President Ajay Lallu in custody.""The Congress leader alleged that all charges against Lallu are ridiculous.""In the FIR, he has been accused of causing loss to the people, which is ridiculous because he was helping people,"" she said.""Everyone in Uttar Pradesh understands this dirty politics of the BJP government. Ajay Lallu ji has struggled a lot and worked hard. He is being targeted for helping the labourers,"" Shrinate alleged.","""You are not just misusing government machinery, you are also inciting vendetta politics.

Aditi Singh: Congress playing petty politics over buses,"Aditi Singh

LUCKNOW: Congress rebel MLA from Rae Bareli, Aditi Singh , on Wednesday accused her party of playing petty politics over the issue of arranging buses to ferry migrants to their homes.

Terming the Congress initiative of providing buses for migrants a ‘cruel joke’, Aditi said of the 1,000 buses that Congress offered, many of them had no documentation or were trucks and autorickshaws.

“What is the need of such low level of politics at the time of a disaster. A list of one 1,000 buses was sent and more than half of the registration numbers were fake, 297 were junk buses, 98 were autorickshaws and vehicles like ambulance, 68 vehicles were without any papers,” the rebel MLA tweeted. “What cruel joke is this? If there were buses then why did you (Congress) not send them to Rajasthan, Punjab and Maharashtra (to ferry migrants),” she added. Aditi said that there was no room for petty politics over the plight of migrants

The MLA, who was once considered close to the Gandhi family, also questioned why the Congress government in Rajasthan did not arrange any buses to send back UP students stranded in Kota. “Where were the so-called buses when thousands of children from UP were stranded in Kota,” Aditi said, adding that it was due to CM Yogi Adityanath ’s efforts that UP students were brought home from Kota which even drew a praise from Rajasthan CM.

Congress veteran Satyadev Tripathi , who is sulking after the reorganisation of UP unit, also targeted his party over the buses row. “The Congress leadership is busy in a cheap publicity stunt.”

Congress legislative party leader Aradhana Mishra said: “The application (to disqualify Aditi Singh) is pending before the Speaker and we hope that he will take a call soon. But we will pursue the matter once again.”

No politics on corridor please: SGPC,"This story is from December 3, 2019

Amritsar: Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Gobind Singh Longowal on Monday hit out at Pakistan railways minister Sheikh Rashid’s statement that the neighbouring country hurt India by opening the Kartarpur corridor.

“This is solely a religious issue and no one should play politics over it,” Longowal told TOI on Monday, two days after Rashid made the statement at an event in Pakistan. Longowal said a few forces were trying to raise the issue of Kartapur corridor at international level to serve vested interests, but the matter was of religious importance for Sikhs and it had been finally settled after 1947.

Stating that Sikhs in India were deeply hurt by Rashid’s statement, Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) president Manjinder Singh Sirsa sought clarification from Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan.

“First, it was Khadim Hussain Rizvi (founder of the far right Islamist political party Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan) who spewed venom against the corridor who is saying the corridor is the brainchild of (General Qamar Javed) Bajwa and Pakistan aims to hurt India through it. I think something is brewing in Pakistan to close the corridor,” Sirsa said.

He asked Khan to clear the air over his minister’s statement and suspend him from his cabinet, and also lodge a case against the Maulana under Blasphemy Act.

DSGMC former president Paramjit Singh Sarna said the statement should not be taken seriously. “May be Rashid and Bajwa are not on good terms and Rashid gave such a statement to embarrass him. It happens here too. For example, Punjab’s Congress leadership sometimes gives undesirable statements against chief minister Amarinder Singh. So, we shouldn’t take his statement seriously,” he said.

When asked that Rashid’s statement could be interpreted as Pakistan army’s conspiracy of opening the corridor to fan anti-India sentiments by encouraging Khalistani Sikhs, Sarna, who is also president of SAD (Delhi), said there were hardly a few people who talked about Khalistan in India. “Those who talk about it do so only to gain media attention, win sympathy of a few Sikh leaders abroad, and get dollars as charity,” he said.

Cong accuses Yogi of playing politics overmigrants by delaying entry of buses in UP,"Agra: High political drama was witnessed at the UP-Rajasthan border on Tuesday as scores of Congress leaders were detained after they staged a protest against the state government’s “refusal” to permit the buses arranged by party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi to enter the state for ferrying stranded migrant labourers to their destinations.

The protesting leaders accused the Yogi Adiyanath government of playing politics while claiming that 500 buses parked along the Rajasthan border near Fatehpur Sikri were not being allowed to enter UP.

“The government is purposely delaying the vehicles due to its vested interests,” alleged UP Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu, who also went to the border.

Lallu, along with former CLP leader Pradeep Mathur, AICC secretary Vivek Bansal and party leader Mukesh Dhangar, was detained by Agra police after they staged a protest at the border and raised slogans against the government.

Accusing the BJP government of betraying the poor people of the state, Mathur termed the government “anti-poor and anti-migrant”.

“This government doesn’t want to help the poor and is only pretending to be doing so. We have been trying to take buses to UP since morning, but top government officials are busy issuing insignificant letters to delay the buses’ entry,” Mathur told TOI.

Meanwhile, Priyanka Gandhi shot another letter to the UP government on Tuesday, stating, “I want to appeal to the UP government once again that this is the time to display sensitivity. Please grant us permission so that we can proceed.”

“UP’s migrant labourers are worried. We can together overcome this challenge. We request you to grant permission so that our buses can reach Noida and Ghaziabad via Agra,” she further stated.

A massive political blame game erupted over Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s proposal to send 1,000 special buses to UP for ferrying stranded migrants.

Earlier, reacting to the Congress’ proposal, the Yogi government asked the Congress to send 500 buses each to Noida and Ghaziabad and sought the details of buses. Later, the government claimed that the details of vehicles provided by the opposition party also included two-wheelers and cars, fuelling a war of words between BJP and Congress leaders.

When contacted, Agra SSP Babloo Kumar refused to comment on the issue, but confirmed the detention of some Congress leaders.

Agra SSP said that an FIR has been registered against Ajay Kumar Lallu and Vivek Bansal under section 188 and 269 of IPC at Fatehpur Sikri police station

NEW DELHI: In a massive setback for the Congress, its prominent youth leader Jyotiraditya Scindia quit the party and appeared set to join BJP Tuesday amid a rebellion in Madhya Pradesh by his supporters, pushing the 15-month-old Kamal Nath government to the brink of collapse.His resignation stirred the politics in Madhya Pradesh triggering a host of political reactions. Here is a look at how various political leaders reacted to the news of Scindia quitting the Congress —There is nothing to worry about, we will prove our majority. Our government will complete its term.For some Congress leaders when Scindia ji was in Congress he was a Maharaja, now he is a mafia? These are their double standards.We have evidence that three chartered planes (which reportedly flew Congress MLAs to Bengaluru) were arranged by the BJP. This is part of a conspiracy to reverse the mandate of people of Madhya Pradesh because Kamal Nath has acted against mafias.So yes it will indeed be a loss to our party and I don't think our government in Madhya Pradesh will survive. This is the present-day politics of BJP, always tries to topple and destabilize opposition governments. Scindia ji held many senior posts in Congress party and was well respected, maybe he got lured by the offer of ministership given by Modi ji. We know his family has been associated with BJP for decades yet it is a big loss.Meeting (legislative part meet) was good. All Congress MLAs, including independents, were present. We have the number, we'll fight this together. MLAs who were rounded up were told that Scindia ji has to demand a Rajya Sabha seat so they need to come together. But when the talks of him (Jyotiraditya Scindia) going to BJP started, these MLAs became angry. They are all in contact with the chief minister. The government has no threat, we will prove the majority in the Assembly.Scindia has betrayed the trust of people as well as the ideology. Such people prove that they can't thrive without power. Sooner they leave the better. Joining hands with the BJP in a time of national crisis speaks volumes about a leader's self-indulgent political ambitions, especially when the BJP is ruining the economy, democratic institutions, social fabric and as well the judiciary.How many leaders are they going to expel? If they continue expelling their leaders like this, soon the day will come when only Sonia and Rahul Gandhi will be left in the Congress.Congress is ready to fight back if the need arises. We have 94 MLAs, nobody can break the morale of the party.I am very happy and congratulate him. This is 'ghar vapasi'. Madhavrao Scindia had started his political career with Jan Sangh. Jyotiraditya was being neglected in Congress.The state government is strong and it will continue to run. The government is not going to fall because someone is saying so. We have required number of MLAs.I have resigned from the Congress as well as from the membership of State Assembly. I have joined BJP. Most of the Congress MLAs will resign from the Congress in coming days as they are fed up with the functioning of Kamal Nath government.I am not surprised that Jyotiraditya Scindia resigned from Congress and will join BJP. I feel he will be sent to Rajya Sabha and inducted into Union cabinet. His father Madhavrao Scindia would have been Prime Minister if he were lived.I have come to Bhopal with the resignations of 19 MLAs who are currently in Bengaluru.

Madhya Pradesh Government crisis: Latest developments,"This story is from March 10, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Congress party suffered a major setback on Tuesday when one of its senior leaders Jyotiraditya Scindia resigned from the party along with 22 Congress MLAs from Madhya Pradesh. The Congress in the evening asserted that it has the support of required MLAs to prove majority in the state assembly and the government is not under any sort of threat.

Here are the latest developments from the day —

We'll prove majority: Kamal Nath

""There is nothing to worry about, we will prove our majority. Our government will complete its term,"" said chief minister Kamal Nath.

Govt has no threat, we will prove majority in assembly, says Congress

""Meeting (legislative part meet) was good. All Congress MLAs, including independents, were present. We have the number, we'll fight this together. The government has no threat, we will prove the majority in the Assembly,"" said Congress leader Shobha Oza. Congress leader Laxman Singh seconded Oza's remarks. ""Congress is ready to fight back if the need arises. We have 94 MLAs, nobody can break the morale of the party,"" he said.

Congress accuses Scindia of 'satisfying personal ambitions'

In a resolution passed in the Congress legislative party meet in Bhopal, the party leadership slammed Scindia's decision to quit the party. ""Congress legislative party condemns the unfortunate manner in which attempt has been made to insult the people's mandate by satisfying the personal ambitions of Jyotiraditya Scindia,"" the resolution read. 'Around 100' MLAs including four Independents attended meeting, a minister said.

BJP legislative party meeting underway in Bhopal

A BJP legislative party meeting is underway at the party office in Bhopal. Union minister and MP from Damoh, Prahlad Patel, and other senior leaders of the party are present in the meeting.

BJP leaders submit resignation of Congress MLAs to assembly speaker

Leader of Opposition in state assembly Gopal Bhargava, Narottam Mishra, and other BJP leaders reach the residence of state assembly speaker NP Prajapati to submit the resignations of 19 Congress MLAs.

""I will take action according to the established procedure of the state assembly,"" Prajapati said after receving the resignation letters.

22 Congress MLAs from Madhya Pradesh tender resignation

As per the latest reports, 22 Congress MLAs from Madhya Pradesh have tendered their resignation by Tuesday evening. Congress MLAs from Sumawali (Morena) Adal Singh Kansana and Manoj Choudhary from Hatpipliya constituency in Dewas were the latest to send their resignations.

Earlier, as many as 19 MLAs of the ruling Congress in Madhya Pradesh, most of them believed to be loyal to expelled party leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, sent their resignation letters via e-mail to Raj Bhavan. ""We have received resignations of 19 MLAs through e-mails with attachments,"" a Raj Bhawan official told PTI.

Scindia tenders his resignation to Congress president Sonia Gandhi

Jyotiraditya Scindia finally resigned from the primary membership of the party and sent his resignation letter to interim Congress president Sonia Gandhi. Prior to tendering his resignation, Scindia held an hour-long meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The resignation is dated March 9, suggesting the decision was taken a day earlier.

While tendering his resignation, he cited, ""...as you well know, this is a path that has been drawing itself out over the last year."" He added that he is ""unable"" to ""serve"" people have been a part of the Congress.

He added that to respect the ""aspirations of my people and my workers"", he has taken this decision.

On its part, the Congress expelled the party general secretary and scion of the erstwhile Gwalior royal family on charges of anti-party activities.

Jyotiraditya Scindia meets Amit Shah & Narendra Modi

Amid a political crisis in Madhya Pradesh, Shah and Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia were seen leaving from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Lok Kalyan Marg residence on Tuesday. At the PM's residence, the three leaders were huddled in a meeting for over an hour.

Twenty ministers in Kamal Nath government resign

On Monday evening, the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh plunged into a political crisis after a sulking Jyotiraditya Scindia, along with at least 17 MLAs, virtually raised a banner of revolt prompting CM Kamal Nath to call a late-night cabinet meeting where around 20 ministers present resigned reposing their faith in his leadership.

Nath had cut short his Delhi visit and rushed to Bhopal where he had called the urgent cabinet meeting at around 10 pm after a faction led by senior leader Jyotiraditya Scindia who, along with at least 17 legislators, went incommunicado, sparking intense speculation about the fate of his government.

Many of these legislators, including ministers, had flown to Bengaluru earlier in the day.

Scindia's conflict with the Congress party

Scindia, once considered a rising star of the party, has long been at loggerheads with Kamal Nath who belongs to the old guard. After narrowly winning the state Assembly elections in December 2018, Kamal Nath took over as chief minister.

But trouble started brewing recently when Scindia's supporters in the government were side-lined, and it appeared that his ambitions to be the state Congress president were also thwarted. It was also clear that the central leadership was not ready to listen to his grievances.

This weekend, Scindia and six ministers in the Kamal Nath Cabinet went to Bengaluru and became incommunicado. It then became clear that a rebellion was brewing in the party and Kamal Nath would lose the support of the six ministers as well as other MLAs loyal to Scindia.

MP was one of the three major states where the Congress evicted BJP in the series of Assembly elections before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

How the numbers stack up

With Scindia quitting the party, the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh appeared headed for collapse as the former Guna MP has the support of at least 17 legislators.

The Congress has a wafer-thin majority in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly whose current effective strength is 228. If the resignations of the 17 MLAs is accepted, the strength of the Assembly will fall to 211. The magic number for retaining the majority then will be 106. The Congress, however, will be left with 97 seats while the BJP has 104 seats. The Congress has the support of four Independents, two BSP and one SP MLA, but is unclear if they will continue to support Congress or go with BJP.

How political turmoil hit Madhya Pradesh’s coronavirus fight,"Representative Image

BHOPAL: It was March 20 -- the day Kamal Nath resigned as chief minister of Madhya Pradesh after three weeks of political turmoil – that the first Coronavirus patients were detected in Jabalpur. There was no known Covid-19 case in Bhopal or Indore then. Now, less than four weeks later, the two cities have over 1,000 cases and Madhya Pradesh has shot to #3 in coronavirus count in the country.It’s been 25 days since chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan took oath for a fourth term, but MP is yet to have even a health minister or home minister, let alone a cabinet.Chouhan has been non-committal on swearing in a cabinet for now, saying the “focus is on combating the pandemic”. On April 13, he set up a 'BJP task force', packed with party leaders, to tackle Covid-19. Three days later, Madhya Pradesh had a record 391 cases, and the CM sought to reassure people by saying that the numbers are going up because so has testing.With lakhs of residents confined indoors in containment zones, the question on people’s minds is did the political turmoil cost the state dear in the fight against coronavirus?On April 16, CM Chouhan said in a video statement: “There had been no meeting on coronavirus with the chief minister in attendance till I took over. Health staff had also not been trained on how to protect themselves from infection.”However, Tulsi Silawat -- who was health minister in the Kamal Nath government till he went away to Bengaluru with 17 MLAs of Scindia group on March 10 -- differs. Asked if there was a delay in focusing on coronavirus threat and whether he, too, was responsible for it to an extent, he told TOI: “No. I had convened a high-level meeting on March 5 on coronavirus, which was presided by the then chief minister. Madhya Pradesh was the first state where an appeal by the chief minister was published in newspapers, but then I resigned on March 8-9 and Tarun Bhanot was given charge. Coronavirus threat was not that potent at that time but it’s a challenge now, both for MP and India. We should stop politicising the issue and do what the PM and the CM are asking us to do.”The political turmoil consumed the larger part of March, when coronavirus was spreading its tentacles undetected. The administration – which too was gingerly watching the political twists and turns -- began making efforts on its own, but in hindsight it was clearly far from enough.Bhopal collector ordered lockdown on March 22 and Indore followed the next day. Just two days after lockdown, Indore would have its first Covid-19 death on the night of March 25.State BJP chief V D Sharma admits there was a “little delay” in focusing on the coronavirus threat in MP due to the political crisis in March, but blames the Congress. “It was a Congress-made crisis. We never aggravated the crisis at any point in time. They indulged in horse-trading, tried to wean away (BJP MLAs) Sharad Kol and Narayan Tripathi. Later, conflict within Congress led to revolt. As a political party, we could not have kept our eyes closed to all that. But, if there has been a delay in making all-out efforts to control the spread of Coronavirus infection, Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh are responsible for it. We only responded to the crisis. Otherwise also, Kamal Nath says, Rahul Gandhi had warned of Coronavirus spread on February 12. What was he (Nath) doing for a month? Not a single test was conducted, nor were kits purchased,” Sharma said.Former minister Sajjan Singh Verma, a close confidante of Nath, also acknowledges there was a delay in preparing to tackle the coronavirus threat but holds BJP responsible. “We had said suspend the House because it’s time to fight coronavirus. The Speaker adjourned the House on March 16 because of the impending coronavirus threat. At that time, Shivraj Singh Chouhan had sarcastically said he didn’t know that the Speaker was an astrologer. If we had continued in the government for some more days, we would have attended only to Coronavirus. It was our intention, too, but BJP in its lust of power, undermined the coronavirus threat, which is now killing hundreds of people.”State Congress media cell in-charge, Jitu Patwari, however, said: “Despite the political crisis, we were focusing on coronavirus. We knew the gravity of the situation. The Speaker adjourned the House on March 16 because of coronavirus. Chief minister Kamal Nath resigned rather than prolong the issue further. The decision to close down cinemas and malls was taken by our government only. We were on the right path, but BJP’s lust for power aggravated the situation.”","Representative ImageBHOPAL: It was March 20 -- the day Kamal Nath resigned as chief minister of Madhya Pradesh after three weeks of political turmoil – that the first Coronavirus patients were detected in Jabalpur.

‘Women empowerment is a slogan for electoral politics’,"This story is from March 8, 2020

A single mother, Prashanti Tiwari fought a legal battle against sexual harassment at workplace. She shared her experience with TOI’s Sheezan Nezami on the eve of International Women’s Day. Excerpts:

This Women’s day theme is #EachforEqual with a message to make gender equal world. What will you say?

A theme is nothing more than that. Behind the message of ‘Individual Collectivism’ manifested in #EachforEqual is a dark reality of the struggle of half the world for right to dignity, equality and equity which often get ignored or ridiculed.

People and policymakers talk about women empowerment. What is the reality?

As a survivor of sexual assault and harassment, I have experienced that the political system and the ruling elites have reduced this issue to mere electoral politics with catchy slogans and empty assurances.

How difficult it is for a woman to go against patriarchal system?

For a woman, speaking out is more dreadful than the crime itself. I was labelled and branded as a dirty woman, a liar and what not. The entire society isolates you. During the struggle, I lost everything — job, self-dignity and savings. But I take pride that after long criminal investigation, the accused was found guilty. Women should speak out and be prepared mentally and emotionally to face the challenges.

You supported #MeToo movement. But some men said it was a tool used by women to get popular or harass their bosses?

It’s a shame on those who believe that women do this for fame or to harass men. Naming the perpetrator or speaking out against the crime is the beginning of more assaults and the impact is more painful, destroying and everlasting than the act itself. Women literally lose everything in the process. No woman will ever do this for fame or for any other purpose. We have to start believing in women.

Can you tell something about ‘We Matter’?

It is an alternative media platform to provide safe space to those women and girls who want to speak out against the atrocities on them. Recently, we did a story on a bar dancer and the violence she faced. It was not told anywhere.

You are working for women who are suppressed and mistreated, physically as well as sexually. What is common among them, especially when it comes to support from family and friends?

These women received same treatment from the institutions, systems, family and friends. The initial reaction is to assign a purpose for speaking out. Its only the self-belief, conviction and perseverance that help and keep them motivated. One has to be prepared emotionally, mentally, physically and financially for the struggle. Only proper preparation helps.

What will be your suggestions to women who suffer atrocities silently?

Remaining silent means injustice to several other women and girls who remain vulnerable to such crimes. Don’t be shy or afraid. Don’t hide your name or face. It’s the accused who needs to hide his name or face. By revealing your identity, you already win half the battle. The perpetrator does not want this to happen because he is afraid that if the victim reveals her identity people would identify him too.

Any suggestion for men?

Believe Women!

","People and policymakers talk about women empowerment.
For a woman, speaking out is more dreadful than the crime itself.
Women should speak out and be prepared mentally and emotionally to face the challenges.
But some men said it was a tool used by women to get popular or harass their bosses?

Congress

NEW DELHI: The two biggest political parties - BJP and Congress - have put aside their respective major political works and shifted focus on relief works in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak and the ensuing lockdown since March 25.The public meetings, protests, demonstrations or even membership drives have been stopped ever since Janta Curfew was observed on March 22.The regular group meetings of the two parties are off for now.However, much of the focus of the two biggest national parties has shifted towards carrying out relief works for the people who have been hit by the lockdown. The political programmes have been replaced by social service, particularly for the migrant workers and the needy.Talking to the timesofindia.com, BJP national general secretary in charge of West Bengal, Kailash Vijayvargiya , informed that party president JP Nadda makes eight to ten video conference calls every day to talk to party workers.Vijayvargiya said, “For example, Nadda talks to national general secretaries at least every alternate day. He also talks to other office-bearers, members of different cells and departments such as lawyers, doctors, chartered accountants and other professionals, all the party MPs and MLAs from different states.”He said normal political activities such as public meetings and rallies, membership drive, political demonstrations and protests have been called off. The main focus of Nadda's meetings with party functionaries is to chalk out strategies to ameliorate the condition of the migrant workers and other poor sections of the society. “For example, our party workers are helping the poor to get ration cards made,” he said.On his political engagements, Vijayvargiya said even though he is in his hometown Indore since lockdown, he keeps talking to the MPs, MLAs, office-bearers and members of different cells and departments of West Bengal BJP regularly on video call.“Besides the relief measures, we also discuss political programmes in West Bengal, which goes to polls next year. We decide about holding protests against the Mamata Banerjee government through slogans and placards at the booth level,” he said, adding that meetings are being held to inform the people about the Modi government’s achievements.While carrying out all these activities, the party workers wear masks and maintain social distancing, Vijayvargiya said.India’s principal opposition party has put a stop on all political activities.A senior Congress functionary told timesofindia.com on the condition of anonymity that it was not the time for politics but to do something positive. “Politics can wait. It is the time bring relief to those who have been worst affected by the novel coronavirus pandemic,” he said.He said the state units of Congress are carrying out relief work on the ground and supporting the migrant workers by providing them food, water and shelter.The senior functionary said political activity of a different nature was in progress. For example, the Haryana Congress contributed a cheque for Rs 40 lakh to Haryana chief minister ML Khattar earlier this week.He said as far as top leadership is concerned, Congress president Sonia Gandhi has been holding meetings through video conferencing with leaders such as the party office-bearers, in-charges of departments, state unit chiefs and general secretaries on a regular basis.Similarly, he said, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi has also been active during this lockdown period. He has already held three press conferences - two with Delhi journalists and one on Saturday with the regional correspondents.Besides, he spoke with former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan and Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee over COVID-19, its impact on the economy and ways and means to salvage the situation.On the economic front, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have written to the PM on ten separate occasions offering specific solutions and the way ahead of these trying moments.The senior functionary also said the party’s communication department has been working every day since Lockdown 1.0 on March 25. The communication group, led by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with Randeep Singh Surjewala as its convener and Rahul Gandhi, former Union ministers P Chidambaram and Manish Tewari as members, has also been active in organising press conferences and giving out information to the media.On the role being played by the party rank and file during novel coronavirus outbreak, Surjewala said, “Congress and its cadre are playing a frontline constructive role by addressing and articulating COVID issues, espousing humanitarian challenges and offering critique-based solutions to the government as a responsible opposition party. As the principal opposition party, we believe that constructive support involves showing the mirror of truth to the powers that are.”He said, “On the health front, Congress put out the ‘Test, Trace, Quarantine’ doctrine, bringing focus to inadequate testing facilities, unavailability of PPEs and N95 masks as also testing kits.”Surjewala said despite the government’s dilly-dallying, Congress rose to the occasion as Sonia Gandhi announced that its state units will pay for return train fare of migrant labourers.","The political programmes have been replaced by social service, particularly for the migrant workers and the needy.Talking to the timesofindia.com, BJP national general secretary in charge of West Bengal, Kailash Vijayvargiya , informed that party president JP Nadda makes eight to ten video conference calls every day to talk to party workers.Vijayvargiya said, “For example, Nadda talks to national general secretaries at least every alternate day.
He also talks to other office-bearers, members of different cells and departments such as lawyers, doctors, chartered accountants and other professionals, all the party MPs and MLAs from different states.”He said normal political activities such as public meetings and rallies, membership drive, political demonstrations and protests have been called off.

Kabul attack: Dozens killed as gunmen attack Afghan political rally,"This story is from March 7, 2020

Security personnel arrive near the site of an attack in Kabul, Afghanistan (AP)

KABUL: Dozens of people were killed when gunmen opened fire at a political rally in Kabul on Friday, the deadliest assault in Afghanistan since the US signed a withdrawal deal with the Taliban.

The attack, claimed by the Islamic State group, highlights a glaring lack of security in the Afghan capital just 14 months ahead of the scheduled withdrawal of all foreign forces.

It also calls into question a key element of the US-Taliban deal signed February 29 -- whether the Taliban can stop jihadists such as IS from running amok in Afghanistan after US forces pull out.

In a statement, IS said two brothers had targeted a ""gathering of apostates"" with machine guns and grenades.

The gunmen inflicted devastating carnage at the crowded event in west Kabul, killing 32 people and wounding 58 others, health ministry spokesman Wahidullah Mayar told AFP.

Interior ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi put the toll at 29 dead, with an additional 61 wounded. He said special forces units eventually killed the two gunmen.

The assault occurred at a commemoration ceremony for Abdul Ali Mazari -- a politician from the Hazara ethnic group, most of whom are Shiite Muslims.

The Sunni-extremist IS had claimed an attack on the same ceremony last year, when a barrage of mortar fire killed at least 11 people.

Rahimi said gunfire had erupted from a construction site near the event.

Several top political officials were at the ceremony, including Afghanistan's chief executive Abdullah Abdullah .

The interior ministry later confirmed that all the high-ranking officials had been ""safely evacuated.""

""We left the ceremony following the gunfire, and a number of people were wounded, but I do not have any reports of martyred people for now,"" Hazara leader Mohammad Mohaqiq told Tolo News.

President Ashraf Ghani condemned the massacre as a ""crime against humanity"".

The attack came less than a week after the US and Taliban signed a deal that would result in the complete withdrawal of foreign troops in 14 months.

The withdrawal however depends heavily on the Taliban being able to control jihadist forces such as al-Qaeda and IS.

If such groups remain, so too does the US military.

A US Forces-Afghanistan spokesman said the response to the attack was ""Afghan led,"" but US personnel gave medical aid to the victims.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo insisted that despite the attack, violence in Afghanistan was ""significantly down"".

""The violence levels, they're still lower than they have been in the last five or six years,"" Pompeo told CNBC television.

""We see the path forward towards a peace and reconciliation opportunity.""

He later condemned the ""despicable"" attack, saying in a statement that the peace process ""presents a critical opportunity for Afghans to come together to build a united front against the menace of ISIS.""

But since the deal was signed in Doha fighting has continued across Afghanistan, raising questions over whether the agreement would reduce violence and lead to talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government.

Afghan government officials and the Taliban are supposed to meet in Oslo next week, but talks are likely to be delayed over disagreement about a prisoner release.

The US-Taliban deal calls on the Afghan government to release as many as 5,000 Taliban prisoners before March 10, when talks are supposed to start. President Ghani however has rejected that commitment.

The Taliban's political spokesman Suhail Shaheen said that the insurgents were ready for talks -- but only if the prisoners were released.

""If the negotiations are delayed beyond the stated date, the responsibility will rest with the others,"" Shaheen tweeted.

The Islamic State group, which follows a radical Sunni interpretation of Islam, first became active in Afghanistan in 2015.

It has claimed responsibility for a string of bombings, including several in Kabul targeting the city's Shiite community.

In recent months the group has suffered mounting setbacks after being hunted by US and Afghan forces, as well as Taliban offensives targeting their fighters.

At the United Nations, Secretary General Antonio Guterres condemned the attack and expressed his ""deepest sympathies"" to the families of the victims.

""Attacks against civilians are unacceptable and those who carry out such crimes must be held accountable,"" Guterres said.

Congress slams Centre for 'tour politics',"This story is from January 10, 2020

NEW DELHI: Congress on Thursday slammed the Modi government for leading a delegation of foreign envoys to Kashmir even as it was continuing to disallow opposition leaders permission to visit the region.

It accused the government of adopting double standards and leading ""guided tours"" to claim normalcy when three former chief ministers are under house arrest and one - Congress MP Ghulam Nabi Azad - was compelled to approach Supreme Court for permission to visit. ""We demand that the government allow unfettered access to J&K to all politicians and not resort to guided tours for envoys,"" senior Congress MP Jairam Ramesh said.

He also demanded ""positive political activity"" in J&K, lacking in the past five months. ""The PM and the home minister are only indulging in statements and counter-statements, claims and counter-claims. Congress wants that meaningful political activities should be initiated in J&K at the earliest. This political tourism of taking the ambassadors on guided tour of J&K should be stopped. This is our demand in the context of J&K,"" he said.

Sourav Ganguly has political skills to lead ICC: David Gower,"Sourav Ganguly. (Getty Images)

NEW DELHI: Former England skipper David Gower feels Sourav Ganguly has the right ""political skills"" to lead the ICC one day and he has already displayed that as BCCI president , which is a ""far tougher job"".

The elegant left-hander is very impressed with Ganguly's leadership abilities and believes that he has what it takes to head the global body in the future.

""One thing I have learnt over the years is that if you are going to run BCCI, you need to be many, many things. Having a reputation like he (Ganguly) has is a very good start, but you need to be a very deft politician.

""You need to have control of a million different things,"" Gower said ahead of ""Q20"", a unique chat show for the fans presented by 'GloFans'.

Gower reckons being president of the BCCI is the toughest job imaginable in world cricket .

""And of course, you need to be responsible for a game that is followed by, I mean, should we say a billion people here in India,"" he said.

""We all know about the immense following for cricket in India. So it is indeed a wonderful thing to behold. Sourav has the toughest task imaginable in charge of BCCI, but so far I would say the signs are very good.

""He has listened, given his own opinion and has pulled strings gently,"" he said.

Political skills are a must in administration and that's where Gower finds his fellow left-hander ticking all the boxes.

""He is a very, very good man and has those political skills. He has the right attitude and can keep things together and will do good job. And if you do a good job as BCCI chief in the future, who knows?

""But I would actually say the more important job, to be honest, is running BCCI. Being head of ICC is an honour, there is a lot that can be done by ICC, but actually look at the rankings, look at where the power is heading up. BCCI is definitely the bigger job,"" he said.

On the cricketing front, Gower believes World Test Championship has given the format much-needed context.

""The idea of this World Test Championship has come about for one very simple reason that people are worried about the survival of Tests. Back in the seventies, eighties, I don't think we needed context to be fair.

""Test cricket was very much more obviously the most important format and if there was anything to be judged by, it was the performances in Test matches both as an individual and as a team.""

BJP campaign misleading: Akhilesh Yadav,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Akhilesh Yadav

LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday said Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was organising outreach campaigns to mislead people as the party has now realised that it’s decision to introduce the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was unconstitutional.

He said that all opposition parties would also launch their own mass awareness programmes about CAA. On Saturday, Akhilesh met the family of Mohammad Wakil, who had died in the CAA violence which erupted in Lucknow on December 19.

Questioning the need for such awareness, Akhilesh said, “What was left unexplained in the Lok Sabha that BJP leaders have to step out to explain CAA to people?”

“BJP jaanti hae ki unhone galat faisla liya hai, jo samvidhan ke khilaf hai...isliye wo samjhaney nahi barglane nikle hain (BJP has realised aware that it had taken a wrong and unconstitutional decision so they have come out not to convince people but to mislead them).”

Kerala govt readies bill that legalises campus politics,"This story is from March 4, 2020

Representative image

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government is ready with a bill that will legalise the elected representation of students in the educational institutions across the state, higher education minister K T Jaleel told the assembly on Tuesday.

Replying to the calling attention motions by Congress MLA VT Balram and CPM’s M Swaraj demanding steps to protect the freedom of the students to organise in colleges and preserve their democratic rights in the wake of the recent high court verdict, the minister said that the bill will be presented before the assembly soon.

A single bench of the high court had recently ordered banning rallies and strikes in schools and colleges in the state and said that academic institutions are only meant for studies. The minister said that the government will consider filing an appeal against the verdict after consulting legal experts.

However, the minister also said that the verdict has not said that students should not have any politics. He said the verdict will not come in the way of legalising student organisational activities. He said that wherever such organisational activities are absent, there is a tendency on the part of anti-social and communal forces to set its foot. He said that the only way to counter such forces is to have legal elected organisations of students on campuses.

Earlier, both Balram and Swaraj said that the court verdict is unacceptable and societies’ power to fight for the protection of constitutional values and against undesirable incidents usually begins from the campuses. They demanded that the government should appeal against the court verdict and also ensure that the rights of the students are not curtailed.

Mayoral posts: BJP vice-chief coming to consult core group,"BJP

CHANDIGARH: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is all set to pick its candidates for the three mayoral posts. Its vice-president and city in-charge Prabhat Jha will arrive on Saturday to start the exercise.Jha will first meet the party’s local core group of MP Kirron Kher, city party chief Sanjay Tandon, former MP Satya Pal Jain, and general secretaries. Then he will have one-on-one meetings with the BJP’s municipal councillors to take their views before he sends his report to the party’s national body in New Delhi.The rival groups of Kirron Kher and Sanjay Tandon are both lobbying for their close aides with the party’s central leadership. Senior member Satya Pal Jain can be a kingmaker and he might be allied with Kher’s views, inside sources have claimed. A senior member of the party’s national leadership said: “Kher and Tandon have done good lobbying for their favourites in this contest for the seats of mayor, senior deputy mayor, and deputy mayor, but the party will try its best to make both sides and their councillors arrive at a unanimous choice. The party will listen to everybody but decide on the basis of parameters, candidates’ situation and background, and their designated role in the party.”Four faces—former city mayors Rajbala Malik and Asha Jaswal—besides councillors Heera Negi and Sunita Dhawan, are in the race for mayor. Malik and Negi belong to the Kirron Kher camp, while Jaswal and Dhawan are Tandon loyalists. Malik served as uncontroversial mayor in 2012 and has experience on her side. Jaswal was also mayor in 2017, but she filed her second nomination against BJP’s official mayoral candidate Davesh Moudgil after that term.Her colleague and now fellow contestant, Heera Negi, had levelled serious allegations against her in 2017 that as mayor, she was behind her loss in the finance and contract committee election. Negi is an experienced councillor but she lost the mayoral election of 2015 to the Congress. Since she could not even win the F&CC election in 2017 despite the’ BJP’s full majority in the house, councillors will have trouble accepting her as candidate for the toughest job.","BJPCHANDIGARH: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is all set to pick its candidates for the three mayoral posts.

Bar wards of power defaulters from taking competitive exams: Ranjit Chautala,"This story is from January 3, 2020

Ranjit Chautala

CHANDIGARH: Haryana power minister Ranjit Chautala on Thursday triggered a controversy while referring to measures for recovery of electricity bill arrears from defaulters in rural and urban areas of the state. Chautala had advocated that children of those defaulting electricity bill payment should be barred from appearing in the competitive examinations without the no-objection certificate (NOC) from the electricity department.

Chautala had said this during his interaction with villagers as well in a press conference organised in Sirsa district. His statement had attracted the criticism from the opposition.

Congress leader and former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda was the first to react. He said, ""How can you link electricity bill arrears with studies? Why should a student pay for parents' fault? This is something unjustified and uncalled for.""

According to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report, arrears of the distribution company (discom) Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) had touched Rs 7,332 crore. Similar is the case of another discom Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (UHBVN), which manages power network in north Haryana. Both discoms had been reeling under severe financial crisis.

The arrears are largely due to unpaid electricity bills and line losses. Government had been running various schemes from time to time to bring down the aggregate technical and commercial loses (AT&C) losses.

The officials of the electricity department refrained from commenting. But Chautala, having been trolled through the day, clarified that he did not have any immediate plans.

""What he meant to say was that just as candidates contesting the panchayat and civic body elections are required to have the NOC from discoms, there should also be such provision for the recovery of arrears from defaulters. His statement has been misrepresented. There is no such plan,"" an spokesperson of the power minister said.

MUMBAI: Shiv Sena legislator Bhaskar Jadhav on Thursday expressed unhappiness over his non-inclusion in the cabinet. “I was expecting a cabinet berth but I have been left out. I have sought an appointment with Uddhav Thackeray to know for myself why I was denied a cabinet berth,” he said.

On the eve of the assembly election, Jadhav joined the Shiv Sena and won from Guhagar in Ratnagiri district. In 2014, Jadhav was elected an NCP legislator.

“I was in the NCP when I was told by Thackeray that I will be inducted in the state cabinet if I joined the Shiv Sena. Accordingly, on the specific assurance of Thackeray, I joined the Sena. Shockingly, I have been left out in the cabinet expansion. Since all the vacancies have been filled up, there is no scope for expansion in future,” Jadhav said.

Jadhav said he did not quit NCP and join Sena only to become a legislator. “Earlier, too, I was a legislator. I joined the Shiv Sena only on the assurance of a cabinet berth. The assurance was given by none other than Thackeray himself,” he said.

On whether his cabinet induction was opposed by NCP chief Sharad Pawar, Jadhav said Pawar would never do so. ”I have full faith in Sharad Pawar,” he said.

MUMBAI: The MVA government will set up nutritious meal centres at all district headquarters and several public places to provide a total of 18,000 Shiv Bhojan Thalis to the poor at Rs 10 in the first phase. Those working in state establishments will not be entitled to the subsidised meal, according to a government resolution (GR) issued on Thursday.

The government has allotted Rs 6.4 crore for the first phase, which will be a pilot for three months. In Mumbai, 450 subsidised thalis will be served in the island city and up to 1,500 in the suburbs, according to the food and civil supplies department.

The scheme, which was promised by Shiv Sena as part of its poll manifesto, will be launched after contracts are awarded for the centres. Besides collector offices, centres will also be set up at district hospitals, bus stations, railway stations and government offices which are visited by the poor or labourers.

Eateries such as Khanaval (home-made food eateries), women self-help groups, bhojanalayas, restaurants and NGOs that run eateries will be eligible to set up the centres. They should have seating arrangement for at least 25 people and would serve 75 to 150 thalis a day. Committees to be set up under collectors at district level and under tehsildars at taluka level will select the eateries.

The government has pegged the cost of the thalis at Rs 50 in urban areas and Rs 35 cost in rural areas. So to provide meal to the poor at Rs 10, the state will reimburse contractors Rs 40 per plate in urban areas and Rs 25 in rural areas.

"Mumbai: Ajit Pawar takes cue from uncle, begins Dalit outreach","This story is from January 3, 2020

Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar reviewed the Ambedkar memorial project on Thursday

MUMBAI: In a bid to connect with NCP’s Dalit voters, deputy CM Ajit Pawar visited Koregaon-Bhima on January 1 and on Thursday paid tributes to Dr BR Ambedkar at Chaityabhoomi and reviewed the Ambedkar memorial project at the Indu Mill compound in Dadar.

Ajit on Wednesday skipped a meeting on GST called by CM Uddhav Thackeray and went to Koregaon Bhima in Pune district, where the ‘Jay Stambh’ marks the battle of 1818 remembered by Dalits where soldiers from the Mahar community fighting as part of the British forces were ranged against the army of the Peshwas. On Thursday, he first went to Chaityabhoomi and then visited the Indu Mill compound. After a review meeting with officials of the implementing authority, MMRDA, the deputy CM told mediapersons, “The project will be completed by April 14, 2022. There are a few formalities to be completed regarding permission. However, work will get started this month.”

He instructed officials that gates of the monument should be high and a tree plantation programme undertaken to ensure more greenery. “After reviewing the project, gave instructions to concerned project officials regarding future work. Discussed key issues including security aspect at the time,” Pawar tweeted.

PM Modi had laid the foundation stone of the memorial in October 2015. During the BJP-Sena government, then CM Devendra Fadnavis had said the project would be completed by December 6, 2020 (Mahaparinivan Din, Ambedkar’s death anniversary), while the Maha Vikas Aghadi has extended the deadline by two years, until April 14, 2022 (Ambedkar’s birth anniversary).

NCP chief Sharad Pawar had, after the assembly poll results, told party leaders to work to win the confidence of the Dalit community. NCP, which won 54 seats, has been concerned about Dalit voters going to the Prakash Ambedkar-led VBA which bagged a sizeable chunk of votes during the LS and assembly polls.

Gujarat: Six of political party held for instigating migrant workers,"Migrant workers in Kubernagar trying to get home

AHMEDABAD: Vatva police on Sunday arrested Arjun Mishra , a resident of Vatva who is also president of Jan Sangharsh Virat Party for allegedly instigating migrant workers against the government.

According to police sources, he and five other used to call or visit migrant workers from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and tell them that the government will not do anything and he would help them get back to their native places. Mishra had fought the 2019 general elections and lost.

ACP Rajpalsinh Rana said the other five with Mishra were Jeetendra Mishra, Manikesh Mishra, Devendra Pandey, Ganesh Vaghe and Aditya Chauhan. “He would get migrant workers together, most of them from the Vatva GIDC area and take down their details saying that he would make arrangements to send them back to UP and Bihar. They have been booked under Sections 188, 185 and 505 of the IPC for spreading rumours,” added Rana.

According Inspector H V Sisara of Vatva police station, when a team was on patrol, they got a tip-off that some persons were about despite the lockdown and and contacting migrant workers.

“Our team quickly reached the spot which near Bachubhai Kuva and saw some persons were talking to migrant workers from UP and Bihar . When asked them what are they doing on the road during the lockdown they could not give a satisfactory reply and they were then brought to the police station,” added Sisara.

Sisara added that during interrogation it came to light that all of them were contacting migrant workers and asking them to register so that they could make arrangements for them to go back to their native places in UP and Bihar.

Rana said that the accused were instigating the workers against the government instead of supporting the government. “We are questioning them about whether they have taken any money either from somebody else or from the migrant workers,” added Rana.

Sisara said all the accused have been sent for Covid-19 testing according to protocol.

‘Haryana government plans to cut ambulance arrival time to 3 minutes’,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Representative image

CHANDIGARH: The average time of an ambulance to reach an accident spot is seven minutes in Haryana. The state government was working to bring this down to three minutes by mapping all ambulances, Haryana transport minister Mool Chand Sharma said on Tuesday. He has directed the health department to compile a data of private ambulances and make it available to the lead agency. He said every ambulance should have a standard format and data bank and exhaustive mapping of ambulances should be done.

Addressing officials during the ‘State Road Safety Council’ meeting here, the minister said level-I services should be provided by the trauma centre, hence the services provided by them should be periodically examined and mapping of private hospitals should also be done.

At the meeting, an action taken report of all the stakeholder departments regarding the decisions taken in the last meeting of the council held on July 9, 2019, was also presented. The minister said that in many places, due to non visibility of the road safety signage, many vehicles are driven on the wrong lane due to which many accidents happen.

Ensuring road safety was the responsibility of everyone and for this it was important to ensure that the necessary signage and boards related to speed limit and nearby trauma centers should be installed in such a way that they were visible from a distance, he added. He said that several signages should be installed on the roads, so that the commuters could be made aware as to where they had to take an accident victim for the treatment. The minister also directed the officers to stop illegal road cuts.

He said in 2020, the government had set a target of reducing the graph of road accidents and casualties. He directed the officials of Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation to put signage and reflectors on the KMP expressway to reduce accidents .

"Karnataka Cabinet: Even with 10 new ministers, swathes of Karnataka unrepresented in BS Yediyurappa cabinet","This story is from February 7, 2020

KC Narayanagowda with wife and daughter after he took oath

BENGALURU/HUBBALLI: Kalyana Karnataka and coastal Karnataka, the BJP’s stronghold in recent times, and the old Mysuru region have virtually gone unrepresented in chief minister BS Yediyurappa’s cabinet, despite threats and protests from a handful of legislators.

From Kalaburagi to Dakshina Kannada and from Davangere to Mysuru, 12 of the state’s 30 districts are not represented in the cabinet even after Thursday, when 10 new ministers joined the 17, who took oath in August. In a first, Bengaluru has the lion’s share with seven ministers out of 28 (including the CM).

Ahead of the expansion, more than 10 MLAs under Shorpur’s Narasimha Nayak (Raju Gouda) had exerted pressure on Yediyurappa to ensure fair representation to the backward districts of Kalyana Karantaka. But only Anand Singh (Vijayanagar constituency of Ballari district) was given a berth.

Amarnath Patil, president, Hyderabad Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the Dr Nanjundappa committee report had recommended at least eight MLAs from the region should be made ministers for it to develop. But the government has only two — Singh and Prabhu Chauhan from Bidar.

“In the absence of fair representation, most of our problems will remain unsolved. With only two representatives, it is not going to help overall growth of the region,” said Patil, while ruing the fact that the region — comprising six districts — lacks a strong voice.

A supporter of Gouda said Kalyana Karnataka has got a raw deal and urged the CM to consider at least three more MLAs during the next round of expansion. Failing this, he said, the BJP could suffer in future elections.

It’s not Kalyana Karnataka alone. The coastal districts of Udupi and Dakshina Kannada have no MLAs in the cabinet. Barring Muzrai minister Kota Srinivas Poojari from Udupi, who is a member of the legislative council, the two districts voted in as many as 11 BJP candidates of a total 12 constituencies.

“Fairness in district representation should be automatically considered by our senior leadership,” said S Angara, seven-time Sullia MLA. “While we representatives of Karavalli [coastal] districts understand political compulsions, we hope the leadership considers the need for fair district representation.”

As for old Mysuru, the BJP lacks MLAs from the region. However, Yediyurappa was expected to swear in at least one of three senior MLAs — SA Ramdas (Mysuru) and KG Bopaiah and Appachu Ranjan (Kodagu). The three had lobbied hard for a ministerial berth but to no avail.

CHANDIGARH: The decision to revise water tariff is being seen as a shrewd political move, due to intense opposition of the public in this regard, said the opposition.

City MP Kirron Kher said she is specially requesting the administrator to approve the house decision to reduce the charges. “Charges must be reduced to give the relief to the people of the Chandigarh. I have been talking to the stakeholders in this regard and I am quite hopeful that Punjab governor and administrator UT will oblige by reducing the water tariff. People cannot be overburdened,” Kher said while talking to TOI.

UT adviser Manoj Parida said, “Since the MC’s general house has approved the revised charges, the matter will be discussed by the governor Punjab and administrator UT and he will take the final decision in this regard.”

Sources in the Bharatiya Janata Paraty (BJP) said the party realised that it did not understand how a hike in water tariff could affect common people before passing the same in December. With people opposing tooth and nail, the party functionaries realised their blunder and are trying to reverse the damage caused on Tuesday’s general house meeting, added the sources.

“It is a fact that we could not understand the agenda properly in December and after passing the agenda, we realised we have committed a huge mistake. Moreover, people have also started coming to us, objecting the same, which forced us to reduce the water tariff,” said BJP’s municipal councillor, pleading anonymity.

Meanwhile, Chandigarh Congress president Pradeep Chhabra questioning BJP’s president Arun Sood’s agenda to reduce the water tariff, said Sood must decide what his own role is before going to the MC house meeting. “BJP has attacked the freedom and autonomy of the MC. BJP councillors and president do not understand the working of administrative machinery either. First, burdening the people by taxing them, then, when people protest, it has become a habit of the BJP to try and cover up its wrong deeds. In this war for credit, the dignity of the MC’s house suffers,” Chhabra said.

When art has politics at heart,"This story is from January 1, 2020

By Gowri Ramanarayan

CHENNAI: The 92-year-old violin maestro T N Krishnan performing a glorious concert on Christmas morning at the packed Madras Music Academy was by itself perhaps the most memorable moment of this music season. But just as you marvelled at the sweep of imagination and sighed over ""Sankarabharanam"", his strings broke into ""Jingle Bells"", wishing everyone a merry Christmas and a happy New Year. That is how, in these times of strife, a master musician reminded us of the values guaranteed by our Constitution.

The Christmas spirit pervaded the intimate ‘arangam’ space as well, where Bharatanatyam artist Geeta Chandran celebrated the birth of Christ with a lullaby to baby Krishna, and a Kabir poem about finding the garden of beauty within each of us. Not merely poignant ‘abhinaya’, but a message of peace.

Tradition, heritage, marabu, parampara — we know they are inextricable from the classical music and dance flooding Chennai sabhas in December. But it would be good to remember that this tradition, unmistakably identified with the Hindu faith, is not with blind hatred toward other beliefs. Nor does it remain static.

In the past, classicism did not mean imperviousness to socio-political currents. Several Old Madras musicians had risked imprisonment for sedition with ""nationalist"" songs against the British Raj, wore khadi, supported social reform, promoted Gandhian values and chanted ""Ishwar Allah tero naam"". M S Subbulakshmi continued to maintain this spirit as she intoned ""Bismillah ir-rahman ir-raheem"" with the same devotion she expressed in her ""Vishnu Sahasranamam"". D K Pattammal’s signature anthem spoke of peace and unity as Gandhi’s vision.

Though music and dance in free India have been more about structure and presentational methods to accommodate changing audience tastes, shifts in politics and society do affect performance. Certain age-old songs have been dropped or edited to match the mood of the times. A few performers have started avoiding compositions now seen as degrading women. Composer Gopalakrishna Bharati’s poignant songs extol the nobility of the outcaste Nandan, but a young Ashwath Narayanan or a Ramakrishnan Murthy follows the more recent practice of substituting neutral, universal terms like deenan (helpless) or ezhai (destitute) for the original words. A rare example was the replacing of ""andanar"" (brahmin) with ""maanudar"" (human being) in a Tamil hymn.

In dance recitals and dance dramas based on mythological grids, many old approaches seem ideologically out of date. The Surpanakha episode in the Ramayana can no longer be treated as a comic interlude as was done in the past. However, audiences can sometimes create new meanings with their ironic re-interpretations, as seen when ‘Kurmavartaram’ was staged at the Bharata Kalakshetra auditorium. Choreographed by Rukmini Devi, this classic depicts the story of how the gods lure the demons to join them in the struggle to extract the elixir which guarantees immortality. Disguised as a bewitching woman, Lord Vishnu tricks the demons out of their promised share.

The viewers were certainly moved by the devotional elements in this story of Vishnu’s avatar, and applauded the dynamic artists with gusto. But, paradoxically, they also saw the performance as a contemporary political allegory of exploitation, empathising with the demon victims than with the gods. In the same theatre, a spectacular ""Panchali Sapatham"" centre-staged the game of dice where the Pandavas lose everything to the Kauravas, including their queen. To the poet Subramania Bharati this was a chilling parable of India enslaved by the British. But to the viewers of today the episode became a gut-wrenching metaphor of their nation, and indeed the world, preyed by greed, megalomania and hatred.

The classical arts deploy metaphors and images, not slogans. Chennai’s Margazhi Utsavam indicates how some artists strive to employ those subtle tools to trigger an awareness of contemporary social problems and ethical dilemmas, to turn performance into a process of healing. They know that audiences are looking for art that lives and breathes in its time, not museumised spectacles. Aptly, Srinidhi Chidambaram’s Bharatanatyam recital ended with a ‘mangalam’ finale asking why faiths abandon love for oppression, and why hearts cannot co-exist in harmony as flowers do.

Visiting British historian decodes politics of the suit,"This story is from February 27, 2020

Christopher Breward spoke at CSMVS on the history of Western fashion in art

Christopher Breward is acutely aware that he is wearing a T-shirt, relaxed Italian pants and trainers when he says he hates the term “business casual”. But he can’t help it. Besides being an “oxymoron” of a phrase, this annoyingly ambiguous corporate dress code also represents a “loss of trust” for this British cultural historian who has written an entire book on the history and politics of the suit. Along with “dress down Fridays”, “business casual” trigger in him the memory of a photograph from the world’s last big economic crisis in which employees in uber-fashionable London can be seen walking out of their establishment with cardboard boxes and without corporate staples of blazers and ties.

Still, you could be excused for describing what Breward, director of collection and research at the National Galleries of Scotland, was wearing during his recent lecture at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya, as “business casual”. On more ostentatious days, the historian—who says he believes “people should wear what they like to express their identity”—tends to favour an understated, bespoke tuxedo, like the one designed by the revered late British fashion designer Alexander McQueen that Breward had received in barter for curating a British Council exhibition. “We needed a bespoke suit by McQueen, sadly no longer with us. He had done a line of suits for a tailor in Savile Row and a bespoke suit has to be made around a living body. So I said to the British Council, I can be the body around which the suit is made,” recalls the lithe 54-year-old, who was in the city to deliver a lecture on the history of Western fashion in art.

Back in the 1980s, casual eavesdropping at art galleries had shown Breward what art connoisseurs were really commenting on while looking at portraits: Clothes, hair and make-up. “I became interested in how fashion could unlock the secrets of meaning 300 years ago,” says Breward, adding now fashion houses have been funding research and exhibitions in recognition of its power to express the history of identity.

That’s how the timeless suit—which radiated patriarchy, masculinity, capitalism, power and even “subversion of authority” with immigrants in 1940s America wearing the high-waisted, tight-cuffed, wide-legged zoot suit to “own its power”—came to preoccupy Breward not too long ago. Contrary to what Indians like to believe, the suit may not have been a Western invention born in the European courts of Louis XIV or Charles II, Breward tells TOI. As a historian interested in the imports of colonialism, he tends to lean towards the theory that the attire may have had its origins in the 16th century Mughal courts of India.

"Get involved in internal political processs in Afghanistan, US urges India","Representational photo.

The US asked India to get involved in the internal political process in Afghanistan, including looking at “proposals for different formulations that would include separate strands in Afghanistan”, even the Taliban.

Sources said this formed the core of the discussions between US special envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad and foreign minister S. Jaishankar , NSA Ajit Doval and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla in Delhi on Thursday.

The visit had a “level of urgency” — Khalilzad could have come later, but he chose to come all the way for a couple of hours, they said. The urgency comes from a perfect storm including a fraying peace deal, a political impasse within the Afghan government, increasing violence by the Taliban, and all in a time of a pandemic, destabilising Afghanistan further.

Sources said the US described India as a “major actor” with an important role in ensuring Afghanistan’s peace and development. “We need to remain part of the process if we want to contribute effectively to the process,” they said.

This would be the first time India has acknowledged that it should be part of the larger peace process inside Afghanistan. India has been squeamish about being part of a peace process which includes the Taliban as well as Pakistan in key roles, not wanting to give legitimacy to a terror group that continues to play to the Pakistani tune.

In their conversations, sources said the US wanted India to continue playing a “constructive role” in bringing about peace internally. By supporting the elected government in Kabul, India reckons it has built an equity that would have been elusive if India had joined the bandwagon early to reach out to the Taliban. At this point, India has more influence with the Ghani government than almost any other country, comparable with the US.

The attack on Sikh and Hindu minorities in Afghanistan in recent weeks has also sharpened India’s attention, particularly the fact that the attack on the Kabul gurdwara which killed 25 people was carried out by an LeT-Haqqani network combine, working closely with the ISKP — blowing to pieces Pakistan’s contention that the ISKP and Taliban are opposed to each other. The Haqqani network is a key component of the Afghan Taliban, with Sirajuddin Haqqani as the deputy head of Taliban.

Last week Khalilzad and Jaishankar held a phone conversation which Khalilzad described “I reached out to Indian External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar yesterday to discuss the latest on the Afghan peace process. We talked about the urgency of resolving the internal political crisis and the importance of Afghan leaders forming an inclusive government.”

Meanwhile, government sources said India was transporting 75000 tons of wheat via Iran’s Chahbahar port to Afghanistan — “5000 tons were shipped last month and 10000 tons went on Thursday this week,” they said. India is also trying to send tea and sugar to Afghanistan.

The visit had a “level of urgency” — Khalilzad could have come later, but he chose to come all the way for a couple of hours, they said.
Sources said the US described India as a “major actor” with an important role in ensuring Afghanistan’s peace and development.
This would be the first time India has acknowledged that it should be part of the larger peace process inside Afghanistan.
The Haqqani network is a key component of the Afghan Taliban, with Sirajuddin Haqqani as the deputy head of Taliban."
From pitch to politics: Iraq's new sports minister Adnan Dirjal,"Adnan Dirjal. (Twitter Photo)

BAGHDAD: Former Iraqi football star Adnan Dirjal swapped his studs for a suit this week when he was named the country's new youth and sports minister.

The slender and balding 60-year-old with a quick smile and sloping nose, who was one of Iraq's most prominent national captains, was one of the only recognisable names among 15 ministers approved by parliament on Thursday, after five months of stalemate over a new government.

The fresh cabinet, led by Prime Minister Mustafa Kadhemi, is mostly staffed with ex-ministers and technocrats -- so an all-star name like Dirjal stands out.

His renown appears to have exempted him from the sectarian horse-trading that usually shapes government appointments in Iraq -- Dirjal, a Shiite Muslim, was nominated to the post by a Sunni party.

""Captain Dirjal is above sectarian calculations,"" tweeted parliament speaker Mohammad al-Halbussi, Iraq's most senior Sunni official.

Accompanying the tweet was a grainy video from a 1982 match against South Korea in which Dirjal scored, sparking jubilant cries from the crowd.

But others point to Dirjal's cozy connections with government leaders and businessmen in the Gulf, where he has been based for the past 25 years, as political capital Iraq's Sunnis would be keen to exploit.

Dirjal launched his career in 1979, the same year Saddam Hussein came to power in a palace coup inside the ruling Baath party.

The defender played three seasons at Baghdad's most popular club Al-Zawraa before jumping to Al-Rasheed, owned by Saddam's son Uday, for five seasons starting in 1984.

Uday's reputation for violence included the alleged torture of footballers whom he deemed to have underperformed.

As captain, Dirjal led Al-Rasheed to win several cups and Iraqi league titles. He also played on the national team, helping it win the 1979 Gulf Cup and reach three Olympics.

The games continued through the bloody Iran-Iraq war, which swallowed up most of the 1980s and saw hundreds of thousands of young Iraqi men vanish on the battlefield.

The 1990s saw Iraq struggle under an international embargo -- but football carried on, one of the few sources of respite for an exhausted population.

Dirjal served as manager for the national team in the first few years of the blockade but left Iraq in 1995 for Qatar, where he coached several clubs.

In 2014, he gave up football management for television, working as a sports commentator for several Arab channels.

He returned to Iraq for the first time in 2018 hoping to lead the country's football federation, but his CV was deemed ""fraudulent"" and his bid disqualified.

The new government faces a laundry list of crises, including an oil price collapse, the coronavirus pandemic and brewing tensions between the country's main allies, Iran and the United States.

Dirjal, too, will inherit some tough challenges.

One controversy is over Iraq's Olympic Committee, which was dissolved by US-led occupation forces in 2003 because it was led by Uday Hussein.

The committee regrouped with new members and was active for 15 years, until the outgoing youth minister suddenly cancelled its 2018 membership elections.

The ministry claimed the committee's status was never properly re-established after 2003, adding that its finances should therefore be managed by the ministry.

It is one of a number of administrative hurdles Dirjal will have to face, but many believe the powerful symbolism around his career will play to his advantage.

""He'll work closely with the athletes, and that will help him resolve many problems and re-establish some stability in the world of sport,"" said Jazayir Sahlani, the executive director of Iraq's Olympic Committee.

Much hope is resting on Dirjal, but he seems up to the challenge: at a press conference in Baghdad in February, he was asked what the future of Iraqi football might be.

""We athletes want to be a part of the reforms in this country,"" he answered.

As minister, Dirjal will now finally have his shot.

CHENNAI: Political party leaders in Tamil Nadu on Friday condoled the deaths of 14 guest workers in Maharashtra . The workers were sleeping on a railway track in Gadhejalgaon village in Aurangabad district when they were mowed down by a goods train .

DMK president M K Stalin tweeted, “Pained and anguished to hear about the Aurangabad train accident. On behalf of DMK, I express my condolences for the loss of lives. I urge the Centre and the state governments to work together to help inter-state migrants reach their homes safely.”

“It is shocking to know that the guest workers from other states have been killed in Maharashtra,” tweeted PMK founder S Ramadoss. He said it was worrying that the deaths are happening in the month of May that is widely celebrated as the month of workers.

MDMK chief Vaiko said the workers were from Chhattisgarh and they slept off as they were tired walking to their native state. “Though the Centre has organised trains to take back many guest workers to their homes, better arrangements must be made to prevent such accidents,” he said in a statement.

Manipur: 'Nothing wrong with political science paper',"This story is from February 26, 2020

IMPHAL: Manipur education minister Thokchom Radheshyam on Tuesday defended the questions on the BJP symbol and negative traits of Nehru's approach to nation building, which were asked in the Class XII political science paper . ""The questions were asked from the syllabus,"" he said.

The two questions had created a furore among political circles, with opposition parties calling it ""an attempt to politicise education"" in the state.

The two questions - ""Draw the election symbol of the Bharatiya Janata Party "" and ""Examine any four negative traits of Nehru's approach to Nation Building"" - went viral on social media.

Earlier, the Council of Higher Secondary Education Manipur (COHSEM), which conducts the Manipur state board examination, said the two questions were set from the ""Party system in India"" chapter.

Responding to a question by Congress MLA Surjakumar Okram in the ongoing Budget session, Radheshyam said he discussed the matter with council authorities.

""There is nothing wrong with the two questions, as they were set from the syllabus of the subject,"" he said, adding, ""we need to educate (students) on politics and political parties"".

""This year, the students were asked to draw the election symbol of BJP. In another year, there could be a question on some other political party,"" the minister said.

On the question on Nehru's negative traits, the minister said there was nothing wrong with this question, since knowing the weakness and strength of past leaders would create room for rectification to bring about more development and make a strong nation.

""After learning from past mistakes, people can make a nation greater and turn it into a super power,"" the minister said, adding that giving some ideas of the past leader's mistakes is nothing offensive.

Surjakumar, while stating that the two questions are irrelevant and confusing, sought for a probe into the affairs of setting them and give grace marks to the students concerned.

Congress scrapped Sambal Yojna due to political animosity: Jyotiraditya Scindia,"BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia

BHOPAL: In a scathing attack on Congress party, former Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia has said that the ambitious ‘Sambal Scheme' launched by the BJP government in 2018 was scrapped by the previous Congress government due to political animosity. He said the revival of the scheme would help poor and children.

“The chief minister's Sambal Yojana is for all poor people. The scheme was prepared for the welfare of common public but, the Congress government had scrapped the scheme due to political enmity. Chief minister Shivraj Singh ji has revived the scheme for the common people,"" said Scindia.

The BJP leader further said that under the scheme, government will bear the cost of education of poor students from class one to PhD (doctorate). ""Those who want to avail the benefit should encourage their children to study hard,"" he said.

Scindia also lauded the chief minister's announcement for the labourers, stating, “The welfare steps taken by chief minister Chouhan by introducing labour reforms will surely open new avenues and increase opportunities for employment and industries,"" said Scindia.

Sources said that Scindia is also monitoring relief measures in Gwalior-Chambal region amid Covid-19 crisis.

On Wednesday, he attacked Congress for blaming him on an issue where a tribal family was allegedly quarantined inside toilet in Raghogarh district.

""The reports published about tribal family quarantined inside a toilet comes under Raghogarh district and is not a part of my former Lok Sabha constituency (Guna). Please fact-check before pinning the blame. It is the former Lok Sabha constituency (Rajgarh) of Digvijaya Singh and the assembly of his son Jaivardhan,"" said Scindia.

""Nevertheless, I have requested the district administration to ensure that the family is taken care of,"" he added.

PMK says Anbumani Ramadoss raised 10 questions during zero hour,"This story is from December 27, 2019

Anbumani Ramadoss

CHENNAI: PMK Rajya Sabha MP Anbumani Ramadoss raised 10 questions during zero hour in the Upper House since early this year, party spokesman K Balu said in a statement apropos a TOI report on Wednesday. The government replied to four of Anbumani’s questions, the statement said.

TOI, in a report titled ‘Anbumani has worst attendance among TN MPs’, said that Anbumani had only 15% attendance (during this tenure), that he participated in only two debates; and did not pose any question or move any private member bill.

The PMK spokesman contested the point about raising questions. While it remains a fact that the MP did not raise questions during the question hour (TOI erred in not specifying question hour), the Rajya Sabha website records that four of his questions during zero hour were answered.

Balu said Ramadoss spoke during zero hour on four different issues – global warming, the Cauvery-Godavari inter-linking project, a separate budget for agriculture and additional fund allocation for higher education.

TRICHY: The district witnessed a couple of protests by local people a day before the first phase of election to local bodies, here on Thursday. A group of villagers from Vadipatti hamlet in Valanadu panchayat in Marungapuri union staged a blockade in the village.

They complained of missing booth slips for 120 voters in the hamlet. According to them, their names were included in the voters list for Thoppupatti hamlet in the panchayat. They demanded their votes should be included in Vadipatti hamlet.

As the villagers were persistent with their protest, the election officials and police officers held talks with them. They managed to convince the voters following which they dispersed.

Returning officer Srinivasa Perumal of Marungapuri Union told TOI that all the five booths for the panchayat have been set up at one school. “They will have not need to visit any other distant place to vote. The protest is over now,” he said.

A group of DMK men led by Trichy district MLA K N Nehru went to Malliampathu village in Andhanallur union on Thursday morning when local people confronted them for visiting the people after the end of the campaign period.

Rise above politics to restore order: Amit Shah,"This story is from February 25, 2020

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah held a meeting on Tuesday with Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and representatives of key political parties to take stock of the situation in wake of violence in north-east Delhi and said a professional assessment pointed to the violent protests being “spontaneous”.

At the meeting, also attended by BJP MP Manoj Tiwari, Congress representative Subhash Chopra, Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik and senior home ministry officials, Shah suggested that the local peace committees comprising eminent citizens and elected representatives be reactivated and their meetings held to defuse the tension, quell rumours and ensure coordination with the Delhi Police.

Shah advised leaders of political parties in Delhi to exercise restraint and refrain from making any provocative speeches. He suggested that all should rise above politics to jointly work towards restoring peace and order.

Patnaik briefed the meeting on the violence witnessed on Monday in parts of Delhi as well as the current situation. Shah said professional assessment was that the violent protests were spontaneous. According to intelligence sources, the violence broke out during clashes between anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and pro-CAA groups in north-east Delhi, which is witnessing 8 of the 19 ongoing anti-CAA sit-in protests across the capital. The immediate trigger, it is believed, was the anti-CAA dharna that led to blocking of a road in Jafrabad.

A source said police personnel on the ground were heavily outnumbered by the clashing anti-CAA and pro-CAA groups, giving leeway to anti-social elements among the warring sides to indulge in stone-pelting, arson and even firing with illegal weapons. “The clashes took a communal colour. Police chose to act with restraint, mindful of the high casualties that any use of force in the densely populated ghettos would cause, and the subsequent ripple-effect this may have in other parts of the country witnessing anti-CAA protests,” said an officer. At least 13 people, including a head constable, have died and many others, including police personnel, injured.

Incidentally, the “spontaneous” assessment cited by Shah runs contrary to MoS (home) G Kishan Reddy’s claims — made to ANI on Monday and in a tweet the later — that the violent protests were a “conspiracy” to create chaos in Delhi and “show our country in poor light” at a time when US President Donald Trump was visiting.

A source told TOI there was no prior intelligence about a possible communal flare-up.

The meeting, chaired by Shah, was told that adequate police deployment in violence-prone areas was being ensured and reinforcements sent where required. Special officers would be deployed in the vulnerable areas. The roads were also being cleared.

Shah reassured the state government and political representatives of Delhi that the city police was doing its job, though while exercising restraint. He cautioned against unwarranted criticism of the Delhi Police saying it could negatively impact its morale and noted that it was adequately empowered to decide on the amount of force needed to defuse tension.

Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Kejriwal said all parties are concerned over the law and order disturbances in the capital. “We all want violence to stop. Nobody is benefiting from this violence,” he noted. Calling the meeting “very positive”, Kejriwal said everybody resolved to make all possible efforts to restore order and peace in Delhi.

Meanwhile, Shah has cancelled his visit to Kerala.

"Oppn playing politics instead of helping poor, says CM Yogi","Lucknow: In the midst of a controversy that migrants are being charged train or bus fares to return their home states, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday accused some political parties of “abhadrata” (indecency) by politicising small issues while the central and state governments were leaving no stone unturned in looking after workers.

Without alluding to any specific party, Yogi in a video statement said the Opposition was trying to weaken the country’s fight against coronavirus and that people would pay it back to them.

The CM’s statement comes in the light of Congress president Sonia Gandhi directing the party’s state units to get in touch with the chief secretaries of their respective states and offer to pay for the migrants’ tickets. On Tuesday, BSP chief Mayawati also offered to contribute towards the tickets.

“While the Uttar Pradesh government is standing with the destitute, poor, and youth without discrimination, some political parties are indulging in the politics of selfishness instead of serving humanity. Those who used to usurp funds meant for the welfare of labourers, destitute and women during their tenure are now upset because money is actually reaching these people now,” he said.

He said more than 6.50 lakh labourers and workers have been brought back to the state since the lockdown was imposed. The state has provided each of them with Rs 1,000, a ration kit and ensured that if they were not displaying any symptoms of Covid-19, they were taken back to their homes. More than 10,000 state transport buses had been deployed to take them home, free of charge, the CM said.

Listing out action taken by the Centre and state, Yogi said that a PM Garib Kalyan package had been announced under which Rs 1.70 lakh crore was being transferred to accounts of poor, labourers, women and destitute. He added that the state government had released pensions in advance and also paid Rs 2,000 each to 2.34 crore farmers.

Barrackpore corp move may unsettle political equations,"This story is from February 23, 2020

Barrackpore: The state government’s plan to bring eight municipalities under Barrackpore subdivision is likely to stall civic polls in this part of North 24 Parganas. The proposal was broached two months ago.

A look at the municipalities to be brought under the proposed Barrackpore Municipal Corporation (BMC) — Titagarh, Bhatpara, Naihati, Barrackpore, North Barrackpore, Kanchrapara, Halisahar and Garulia — throws up a political context. These were the municipalities that switched loyalties to BJP soon after Trinamool-turned-BJP leader Arjun Singh won the Barrackpore Lok Sabha seat in 2019. All these municipalities have returned to TMC.

The state government plans to include two gram panchayats in BMC — Mohanpur and Sewli, both run by TMC. Barrackpore SDO Abul Kalam Azad Islam has written to the heads of the municipalities and gram panchayats, asking them to furnish a detailed note on population, fund allocation, expenditure and how the civic bodies function. “The state government is all set to merge the eight municipalities and two gram panchayats into a corporation with headquarters at Barrackpore. The process will take a couple of weeks,” said TMC Panihati MLA and district observer Nirmal Ghosh.

Political parties in North 24 Parganas are back to their drawing boards, planning ways to address the emerging situation. The abolition of eight chairman posts and two pradhan posts is likely to create bad blood. BJP is eyeing the disgruntled while TMC is confident of overcoming the initial glitches.

Politely say no to NPR surveyors: Minority outfits,"This story is from February 23, 2020

NEW DELHI: Representatives from various minority organisations and individuals led by Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind issued a unanimous declaration to reject National Population Register and urged the people to politely decline making available any details to enumerators who may in due course of time reach out to people for seeking information.

They also called upon all the state governments to immediately suspend the NPR process. They also condemned the ""the indiscriminate arrest of people under sedition and similar draconian laws. We demand their immediate and unconditional release and withdrawal of all the charges against them."" The resolution was endorsed by 76 signatories.

The declaration by way of a statement was made after a brainstorming session steered by the JUH faction which has Maulana Qari Usman Mansurpoori as its president. ""The session was attended by leading intellectuals, social activists and academicians of every faith and religion. After due deliberation, all the participants passed a declaration to reject National People Register (NPR) in its totality and exhorted the countrymen not to cooperate with the officials in this exercise,"" the statement asserted.

This session was jointly convened by JUH general secretary, Maulana Mahmood Madani and prominent member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, Kamal Faruqi.

The resolution called “Delhi Declaration” was drafted by a committee led by former Union minister K Rashnam Khan. ""We unequivocally reject NPR as it is a gross violation of Article 14 of Indian Constitution . NPR is the first stage of data collection to prepare NRC as per Citizenship Act 1955 and Citizenship Rule 2003. It is patently discriminatory, divisive, exclusionary and unconstitutional and targets communities on the basis of religion, class, caste and gender.""

It said that the NPR will commence from April 1 to September, 30, 2020. The data collectors will visit each house/household. ""We must politely decline to cooperate or make available any details. We call upon all the state governments to immediately suspend the NPR process. We also appeal to all the law and order enforcing agencies to respect the constitutional rights of the people of India to protest peacefully,"" it stated.

While extending support to the “multi-religious peaceful protest by youth, students and women in many Shaheen Baghs across the country,"" the declaration called upon people to maintain peace at all times and not fall prey to provocations, propaganda and attempts to sabotage the movement.

"Political trolling:BJP approaches police, NCP says recall past","NAGPUR/MUMBAI: BJP leaders have approached Nagpur police commissioner flagging ""threatening messages"" being put out on social media against former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis amidst the Covid-19 situation and registration of ""false cases"" against BJP workers.

A complaint application was submitted to police commissioner Bhushan Kumar Upadhyay on Monday by Nagpur city BJP chief Pravin Datke and others.

A similar complaint was filed by another MLC Prasad Lad with the Ratnagiri district superintendent of police on Tuesday.

Datke alleged that Fadnavis, currently the Leader of Opposition in the state Legislative Assembly, was ""threatened with encounter messages whenever he comes live on social media to talk about the Covid-19 situation"".

""If the Leader of Opposition is being threatened in such manner how will common people stay safe in Maharashtra?"" he asked.

BJP leader and MLC Anil Sole, also from Nagpur and believed to be close to Fadnavis, said that leaders of the saffron party have been constantly targetted by trolls in the last few days.

""Many comments are very personal in nature and are in bad taste,"" he said.

Apart from Fadnavis, former ministers Chandrashekhar Bavankule , Sudhir Mungantiwar and Vinod Tawde were also allegedly got trolled during their social media interactions.

Mungantiwar said online bullying was a deliberate attempt to target the BJP.

""I have retrieved data of the people trolling me during my Facebook live as well as of other BJP leaders. I found that many online accounts have common names which means that some people are purposefully trolling us,"" he told PTI.

Mungantiwar also said the BJP would not stop holding the state government accountable for its performance notwithstanding trolling.

""The Maharashtra government has recently taken action against a so-called BJP leader from Nashik district for allegedly making some offensive remarks. If this is the case, then we are also giving out complaints to police officials. We will see how the state government takes action against these trolls, who are indirectly helping the ruling government,"" said another BJP leader.

The online war with political hues had turned physical when an engineer was beaten up recently allegedly by the men close to state Housing Minister and NCP leader Jitendra Awhad in Thane.

Awhad had also released some of the tweets purportedly posted by the engineer against him and some NCP leaders.

Maharashtra NCP unit president and Water Resources Minister Jayant Patil said police had not taken any action against trolls during 2014-19 (when the BJP was in power) despite several complaints.

""We had then tried to file complaints with police officials in various parts of the state against trolls, but police didn't accept our complaints then,"" he said.

Patil claimed that many social media handles had been supporting then CM Fadnavis and the BJP.

""The BJP should first clarify whether they were paid accounts or not,"" Patil said.

Meanwhile, Nagpur BJP chief Datke alleged that leaders of a ruling party have been criticising the state governor, which he said amounted to indiscipline.

Mahinda Rajapaksa: Lankan Tamils raise release of political prisoners issue with PM Mahinda Rajapaksa,"Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa

COLOMBO: Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa has assured the country's Tamil leaders that he will discuss the release of political prisoners who are being held for up to 15 years with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.

A delegation of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), Sri Lanka's main Tamil party, met the prime minister on Monday for a separate discussion on the prisoners issue after attending an all-party meeting convened by Mahinda Rajapaksa.

The all-parliamentarians meeting was boycotted by the Opposition's United National Party after the government rejected their seven suggestions, which included resuming Parliament to discuss issues related to the Covid-19.

The TNA was the only major Opposition party to attend the meeting.

TNA spokesman MA Sumanthiran on Tuesday said, ""We took the opportunity to meet the prime minister. Our representatives from the north and east presented their problems region-wise.""

""We (also) raised the issue of political prisoners who are held for over 10 years to 15 years,"" Sumanthiran said.

The TNA leader said Mahinda promised to raise the issue with his brother Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the country's president.

Sumanthiran, who is a signatory to the seven Opposition parties letter, said the TNA was firm in their view that Parliament must be reconvened.

President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has dismissed the demands of the Opposition on March 2.

Meanwhile, the country's parliamentary election, originally scheduled on April 25, has been postponed by the Election Commission to June 20 in view of the Covid-19 outbreak.

The new Parliament must convene at least once by June 2 or within 3 months of when the previous one was dissolved on March 2, to avoid constitutional irregularity.

The coronavirus, which first surfaced in China's Wuhan city in November last, has claimed over 250,000 lives and infected 3.5 million people.

The virus has killed eight people with 755 positive cases in Sri Lanka.

"Uddhav Thackeray's Belagavi remark riles Karnataka minister, activists","This story is from December 20, 2019

Uddhav Thackeray

BENGALURU: Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray's describing Belagavi and nearby areas where people largely speak Marathi as 'Karnataka occupied Maharashtra' evoked a strong response from the Karnataka government and pro-Kannada organisations.

""Only a person who is not aware of history and facts can speak like this. He (Thackeray) should be ashamed for making such statements just for political reasons,"" said Kannada and culture minister CT Ravi.

Stating that the statement is mischievous, Ravi said the majority of people in Solapur in Maharashtra and Kasargod district in Kerala speak Kannada. ""Going by his (Thackeray) logic, we should be calling them as 'Maharashtra occupied Karnataka' and 'Kerala occupied Karnataka'. Is it okay with him?"" Ravi asked.

The states were reorganised on linguistic lines and it was done by the Congress government at the Centre. ""Now, Thackeray is heading a government with the help of the Congress. Let him question it,"" he added.

Thackeray, during his reply in the Maharashtra assembly on the governor's address, also accused the BJP-led Central government of failing to protect Marathi-speaking people in Belagavi.

Ashok Chandaragi, coordinator, Confederation of Pro-Kannada Organisation, Belagavi, who has been fighting for the Kannada cause in the border district, chided Thackeray. ""The matter is already before the Supreme Court. Thackeray as CM of a state should have common sense and shouldn't speak on subjects before the court,"" he said.

Claiming that Belagavi has been an integral part of Karnataka and will remain so in future, he said: ""For the past 50 years, Maharashtra has been trying to take Belagavi but hasn't succeeded. It won't suceed in future too,"" he said. He urged the state government to be proactive in protecting the state's interest in the border issue.

BJP starts hunt for chief who’ll resurrect Punjab unit,"This story is from December 19, 2019

BJP

AMRITSAR: The BJP's central leadership and RSS have reportedly begun brainstorming to find a replacement for its Punjab unit chief Shwait Malik for the 'resurrection' of the party, whose leaders have been giving indications to contest the 2022 assembly elections in the state alone.

Malik was appointed the Punjab BJP chief on March 31, 2018, replacing former Union minister Vijay Sampla, a Dalit face who had taken the command of the state unit on April 10, 2016.

Sampla had insisted on leaving the Punjab BJP chief's position to work in his constituency and Malik was brought in to complete remainder of his tenure of three years, which ended on April 9 this year. Party's state leaders are hoping that the election to choose the new head could be held soon.

Punjab BJP general secretary Rakesh Rathore said the process for electing the state chief had begun, but before that all the district presidents would be appointed by December 25. Before electing the new state party head, a minimum of 50% of district presidents had to be appointed afresh in all 33 districts of the party in Punjab.

According to party leaders, there was a consensus on the appointment of a seasoned face if the party aspired to come out of the shadow of its alliance partner Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and make its independent identity in Punjab.

Names of leaders like Manoranjan Kalia, Avinash Rai Khanna, Parveen Bansal and Rathore were being considered for the Punjab BJP president's post.

""We all, irrespective of party or religion, are deeply hurt over the incidents of desecration of Guru Granth Sahib in Punjab. How our alliance partner deals with the situation without taking political mileage for themselves is our concern? Besides we are serious on showing sympathy towards hardliners. It has brought embarrassment to us and we save our skin saying that had there not been differences, we would have been a single party,"" a Delhi-based BJP leader said.

Name of former diplomat and Fatehgarh Sahib ex-MP Harinder Singh Khalsa, who was suspended from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and joined BJP in March, is also making the rounds.

AR Rahman: I am politically illiterate by choice,"Oscar-winning composer AR Rahman feels although the world is going through a socio-political turmoil, and every second person is expressing political opinion in an aggressive manner, he chooses to channelise his energy in making music, stories and art that can bring about a positive change in the mind of the youngsters.The Indian music maestro is all set to take a new step in creativity. He makes his debut as scriptwriter and film producer with the upcoming musical film, '99 Songs'.""I am politically illiterate by choice, because I rather invest my energy to create what I am creating. One of the reasons why I am making films, music and training kids in music is to offer them a space that they can explore away from politics, violence and all things that are negative. I see how everyone is getting into some political opinion and it is a grey area. It is complicated and probably I won't be able to articulate my thoughts as correctly as I can do it through music. For me, serving humanity through art that heals people, that is spiritual is more important when there is too much aggression out there,"" Rahman told media agency.His daughter Khatija was brutally trolled a while back by the Swedish-Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasreen on social media, for wearing the burqa, but Khatija's graceful and befitting answer to the author received huge applauds by netizens.Rahman's '99 Songs' is directed by Vishwesh Krishnamoorthy and the film features Ehan Bhat Edilsy Vargas , Lisa Ray, Manisha Koirala Ranjit Barot and Rahul Ram.What prompted him to take up the challenge of filmmaking? The ‘Mozart of Madras' replied: ""Not taking up challenges and feeling complacent due to success is boring! I mean, none of us are immortal. We all are going to die, but before death happens let us give new ideas a try. My drive is to explore human possibilities. Criticism is okay with me, so many challenges are thrown at us by life. It is worth taking up the challenges!""The songs of his film were released on Thursday in Mumbai. Rahman has created the album with Dolby Atmos. Emphasising on the collaboration, Rahman said: ""When you hear music, good sound technology offers you an experience that is worth cherishing. We get to experience Dolby Atmos in cinema theatres. They are now collaborating with streaming platforms where you listen to music on the phone and still get the same sound quality, without those speakers.""He added: ""When you listen to a song on your phone, you hear a compressed file that tampers the sound, and the nuances are missed. When a 200MB file is made into a 1. 5 MB file, usually you do not get the same quality. But now that is possible courtesy the new sound technology of Dolby Atmos. I am looking forward to it,"" he explained.","""I am politically illiterate by choice, because I rather invest my energy to create what I am creating.

Congress to use attack of Kannur mayor as political weapon,"This story is from February 21, 2020

Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee working president and MP K Sudhakaran. (Image credit: Facebook / ksudhakaran... Read More

KANNUR: The Congress and the UDF would use the alleged manhandling of Kannur Corporation mayor Suma Balakrishnan by the LDF councillors as a political weapon to target the CPM in the local body election later this year, by igniting the people’s sentiments, said Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) working president and MP K Sudhakaran.

""This kind of an attack on a mayor is unprecedented in Kerala and the political ‘goondaism’ of the LDF councillors has crossed all limits, so we would use the public sentiments against the attack and go to the people raising this in the next local body election,"" he said addressing a press conference in Kannur on Thursday.

What is ironic here is that these councillors targeted a woman while the LDF is talking tall about women’s safety, security and freedom, he said, adding that the root cause of this attack was the intolerance of the CPM after it lost the Corporation rule recently.

The councillors targeted the mayor demanding to solve the agitation by a section of the employees but no one asked what the real cause behind the agitation was, he said. The employees wanted to come to the office when they feel so and mark their attendance, which the mayor opposed, said Sudhakaran.

However, she was ready to discuss the matter with them, but the LDF councilors wanted the issue to be solved before the council meeting on February 19, and when she opposed this they targeted her, he said.

Though the CPM claimed that it was the UDF councillors who caused the provocation and even claimed some of them were injured in the attack by the councillors, Sudhakaran and the UDF leaders said they are ready to present the mayor before a medical board, if the LDF was ready to present their councillors who are said to be injured in the scuffle.

The CPM is yet to cope with the reality that it has lost the corporation rule and that is the basic issue, said deputy mayor PK Ragesh. It was after he switched over to the Congress, the LDF lost the corporation a few months back, and ever since that they are at loggerheads, which is the root cause of the present issue.

Senior IUML leader V K Abdulkhader Maulavi, IUML councillor C Sameer and Congress councillor TO Mohanan also attended the press conference.

The UDF had observed hartal in Kannur Corporation limits on Thursday, till 12 noon, following the issue. However, it did not cause problems as the vehicles were on the roads and even some shops remained open before noon. The CPM also observed Thursday as protest day.

"On IFSC, rise above politics: Sharad Pawar to PM Narendra Modi","NCP chief Sharad Pawar (File photo)

MUMBAI: NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Sunday urged PM Narendra Modi to keep aside inter-state politics and reconsider his decision to give the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) to Gandhinagar instead of the city.

He said in a letter that despite the “immense contribution” of the state to G-sec, the Gandhinagar decision “is egregious, erroneous and unwarranted”.

Quoting RBI data, Pawar said that on April 23 the banking sector had deposits of Rs 145 lakh crore, with the state share being 22.8%, followed by New Delhi at 10%, UP at 7.8% and Karnataka at 7.2%.

He said the Gandhinagar decision would be seen as a move to shift financial and business houses outof the state and would create “unnecessary political disturbances”. He said it would cause financial damage to the country and bring international discredit.

Telangana: Farmers’ body urges Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to create irrigation fund,"This story is from December 19, 2019

Nirmala Sitharaman

HYDERABAD: The Consortium of Indian Farmers Association (CIFA) put forth several proposals including Long Term Irrigation Fund and support to opium farmers before Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman during the pre-budget consultation meeting on Wednesday.

Representatives of the CIFA along with secretary-general Bojja Dasaratha Rami Reddy met Sitharaman and asked for the creation of Long Term Irrigation Fund to develop minor irrigation projects, including revitalising of existing tanks, construction of new tanks and ponds, exclusively in rain-fed areas of the country’s backward regions.

The association also sought support for opium farmers. It said opium is imported with utter disregard for the fate of opium-producing farmers in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh ostensibly on quality issues. “The state must actively support the opium farmers by helping them improve the quality of their produce rather than allow indiscriminate import of opium. Similarly, aqua farmers, dairy farmers, tobacco farmers and coffee farmers should be supported,” he said.

CIFA secretary-general Bojja Dasaradharami Reddy told TOI, “The finance secretary informed us that they would decrease the duty on pulses to fight inflation. We have strongly objected to it. In Nandyal of Andhra Pradesh, six lakh metric tonnes of Bengal gram is lying in the godowns. They are auctioned and sold for lesser price.”

CIFA also said that the farming community should have a national irrigation system to provide water for at least one crop.

Besides irrigation fund, CIFA also asked for a permanent water dispute tribunal for interlinking of rivers to provide irrigation to rain-fed areas.

“The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) must be made into an independent statutory commission with adequate representation of farmers’ organisations. The anomalies in cost calculation by CACP need to be addressed. The costs as determined must be inclusive of all costs. Inspite of the initiatives taken by the central and state governments, timely credit is not available to the farmers and more so to tenant farmers. Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana shall be effectively implemented. Tenant farmers are deprived of credit from financial institutes and coverage under PMFBY,” Reddy said.

CIFA said that the median agricultural income is Rs 19,250 per annum, and the amount is just about enough to ensure farmers’ sustenance. “We have also demanded the Income Security Act for farmers, tenant farmers and farm labourers to double their income. Essential Commodities Act shall be repealed. There shall be 0% GST on all agricultural inputs and equipment. More investments should be made in irrigation, mechanization, logistics and marketing facilities,” it said.

Further, it demanded the continuation of rice export incentives and new incentives for the export of tobacco.

“Mango is being produced in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat. Good quality pineapple is being produced in northeastern states, while establishment of commodity groups at regional level integrated at the national level will facilitate the promotion of these horticulture crops,” said CIFA.

They added that these commodity groups will interact with Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority to promote these crops in foreign markets in a manner that the agricultural export promotion departments of EU and USA promote their agricultural products to improve Indian farmers’ income.

HYDERABAD: Wooing the US defence sector, IT minister KT Rama Rao on Wednesday called for direct connections with the state. The minister was speaking at the US-India Defence Ties Conference held in the city on Wednesday.

“I urge US government agencies to directly engage with progressive state governments like Telangana ,” said KTR. His comments come in the backdrop of his being critical of the Centre for overlooking Hyderabad for setting up a defence industrial production corridor recently.

Addressing the US defence industry, he said, “When you have a state like Telangana as your partner, it can champion your issues in Delhi making your job easier.”

Seconding this, IT secretary Jayesh Ranjan said, “At times when industries make their pitch in Delhi or Washington, it can be seen from the prism of vested interests. This can be addressed with the state taking up issues that the industry faces.”

The minister focused on a four-fold strength of the state while pitching for it to be a defence and aerospace hub. A progressive state government, skilled workforce, potent industrial policy and requisite infrastructure, he said made the state’s eco-system an ideal one. Regarding skilling, the minister said that the government is planning to set up a world-class aerospace university in the state shortly. Speaking about the plans for the university, he said, “I invite US defence majors to be a part of this initiative to create large pool of skilled manpower.” He said the state has also been partnering with global institutions to provide aerospace courses so that skilled manpower was available at affordable rates. KTR said the TS-iPass has been rated amongst the best industrial policies in the country.

Ramesh Datla, chairman, Elico Limited, said, “The government must draw a line between the role of public sector units (PSUs) and private sector in the defence space.”

He said often micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) make huge investments in innovative technology only to find production quantities remaining low because the defence sector is still dominated by public sector units. Addressing doubts over the role private local suppliers was vice-president and chief executive Lockheed Martin Indian Private Ltd William L Blair.

He said through their venture with the TATAs, a majority of their components were being made in India.

He added that while they were willing to engage with component providers in different tiers, “they must be able to make strategic investments, get clearances” to rise in the value chain.

While praising the ease of doing business in the city, Joel Reifman, United States consul general in Hyderabad, highlighted another concern of higher tariffs being imposed by the country.

MUMBAI: The decision of the Centre to come up with the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in Gandhinagar instead of the city has come in for criticism.

Congress state unit president Balasaheb Thorat, who is state revenue minister , said the motive was to reduce the stature of the city as the financial capital. “I am surprised and shocked over the discreet silence maintained by the state BJP leadership,” Thorat said.

While NCP president Sharad Pawar echoed Thorat’s views, Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant said the city was being suffocated for political reasons. “We will lodge a protest,” Sawant said.

Congress general secretary Sachin Sawant blamed the previous chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis . He called the move political vendetta.

“PM Narendra Modi always favoured Gujarat, but what shocked us is that even Fadnavis showed his first choice as Gujarat,” he said “We have reason to believe state BJP leaders took active interest in shifting IFSC to Gujarat.”

Fadnavis, now opposition leader, backed the move. He said a centre could still come up in the city. “As CM, I had made efforts to set up the centre in Mumbai. No steps were taken during the Congress rule from 2007 to 2014,” he said.

JODHPUR: Union jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on Sunday said that the new citizenship Act will have to be introduced in Rajasthan. He was referring to the statement of CM Ashok Gehlot who refused to introduce it in Rajasthan. ""Chief minister Gehlot has said that he would not let this Act introduce in Rajasthan. He cannot do this and the Act will have to be introduced in Rajasthan as it is a law now,"" said Shekhawat.

Shekhawat, who landed in Jodhpur on Sunday received a huge welcome from the Pak Hindu migrants and shouted slogans in his and BJP's praise. The minister said that BJP had been working for the migrants and making the nation stronger but Congress leaders and Gehlot only have been protesting this Act, which is unfair.

Before this also, Shekhawat had slammed Gehlot for his statement of use of black money in politics during the inaugural ceremony of the new high court building in Jodhpur. He also flayed Gehlot for using a wrong platform for sharing this political observation saying that a political leader of his stature should keep caution about this, where the legal fraternity of the country was present.

Engineer's pilgrimage to share pain of Pulwama widows,"This story is from December 16, 2019

CHANDIGARH: The images beamed by TV channels of body parts of CRPF jawans clinging to trees at Pulwama on February 14, 2019, plunged a young engineer, Pooja Gupta, into an intense emotional turmoil. If she felt such pain at the loss of 40 CRPF jawans, what would their near and dear ones be going through, she wondered. Pooja then commenced a journey to visit each of the families.

""I have visited 20 of the families till now all over India. The widows release their pent-up feelings and express their inner pain to me as only one woman can share with another. My effort is to lighten the burden they carry within through emotional therapy. I stay with them and I treat their home just like mine. My latest visit was on Friday to the widow, Sukhjeet Kaur, and her son, Gurprakash, who stay in a rented accommodation at HMT, Pinjore. Sukhjeet's late husband, Jaimal Singh of the 26 CRPF, was the driver of the bus that was bombed in Pulwama,"" said Gupta, who is from Bihar.

Gupta was in the city to attend the Military Literature Festival (MLF) at the Lake Club. She was encouraged to attend the MLF by the Bhaderwah-based Vikas Manhas, who has visited 300 families of martyrs of the armed forces. Manhas, Gupta and a group of writers are bringing out a book on the families of the 40 Pulwama martyrs.

""The tragedy of the CRPF martyrdoms is that it is nameless. These jawans did not get posthumous gallantry awards. Neither did they die in an operation against terrorists or died fighting when the camps are attacked by terrorists. No one even knew the names of the 40 jawans, leave aside the families they left behind. I wanted to visit the 40 families but could not do so. It was then that Pooja stepped in and said she would like to take up this task,"" said Manhas.

""The widow of CRPF constable Mahesh Kumar, Sanju Devi, from Allahabad, did not get support from her in-laws. She has two children. She finds herself left alone to fend for herself. Then, there was constable Shivanand of Tamil Nadu, whose daughter was born on October 5 this year. Another martyred constable from Rajasthan, Rohitash Lamba, had a child, Dhruv, born on December 10, 2018, two months before his death. Lamba had put up a FB post on December 10, 2018, stating: 'Today I am a father, will be filling (feeling) great happy'. Each family has such poignant stories which are heart-rending to hear and think about,"" added Gupta.

"Punjab: Both ruling, opposition party leaders are facing heat from within","This story is from December 16, 2019

JALANDHAR: Brewing discontent in a party is usually an opportunity for the opposition. But in Punjab, both head of the ruling party and head of a major opposition party are facing heat from within and the situation has the potential to take troublesome proportions for both of them. Another commonality they share is the roots of their problems converging at the same point — Bargari sacrilege issue.

The Congress cadres would earlier speak against the performance of Captain Amarinder Singh-led government in hushed tones, but they gave it a loud and clear voice in the first meeting of deed-back process. Similarly, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal received brickbats from senior party leader and Rajya Sabha member Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa the very day he got bouquets for getting “re-elected” as president of the party third time in a row. In fact, Dhindsa has managed to get all Badal (especially Sukhbir) bashers, who were disintegrated earlier, on one platform.

Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has been facing heat from within his party for the last over four months, when the monsoon session of Punjab assembly took place and his minsters and MLAs did plain speaking during the Congress legislature party meetings over the perceived failure of his government on the issue of Bargari sacrilege case and other issues of governance.

Later, in the second week of September, he appointed six MLAs as his advisers to tackle the dissension among MLAs after he got the wind that the MLAs were ganging up. If the recent dissatisfaction expressed by the MLAs from his home district Patiala was not enough, the Congress workers enumerated several failures of their party’s government in Punjab when state Congress president Sunil Jakhar held the first meeting in Jalandhar with party workers and local leaders to get their feedback on December 9.

Apart from other failures of the Amarinder government, its failure in getting the probe in Bargari sacrilege case back from the CBI figured prominently at the meeting. The MLAs apprehend that they would feel the heat over the issue on the ground. Punjab jail minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa has already given words to this sentiment prevailing in the party when he addressed Sikh activists who held a dharna outside his residence on December 8.

When it could have been an opportunity for SAD (Badal) to cash in on the trouble brewing in Congress, at least in a perception battle, its president Sukhbir Singh Badal is staring at the battle within his own party. Dhindsa, who has been a close comrade of former chief minister and party supremo Parkash Singh Badal, is now not keeping his dissent subtle. The tone and tenor of his speech at Amritsar on Saturday while addressing the splinter Akali groups was unusual. A soft-spoken Dhindsa, who earlier chose his words very carefully, launched a blistering attack on Sukhbir and announced that there is no question of siting back till the control of one family on SAD, SGPC and Akal Takht. Bargari sacrilege issue also figured very prominently at the common meeting of splinter Akali groups.

What is being seen as a clever move in Akali circles is that Dhindsa is not questioning Parkash Singh Badal. This has made attacks by Sukhbir and his loyalists on him difficult. The veteran Akali leader intends to keep on attacking Sukhbir while remaining within the party fold. He also enjoys good relations with the central leadership of BJP. At a time, when the results of assembly and parliament elections have been demoralising for the Akali Dal (Badal), he has managed to get the other factions of Akali Dal on one platform. There is fluidity of sentiment and confidence within the Akali cadres and supporters and they have been expressing apprehensions about the future of the party in hushed tones.

LUDHIANA: Rubbishing reports of him being unhappy with chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, Gill MLA Kuldeep Singh Vaid has clarified that he has no issues with the CM or the Congress party.

In a statement issued on Saturday, Vaid said neither him nor any other Congress MLA had any issues with the CM, the party or any other senior leader, and any kind of news in this regard in any newspaper or on social media was “completely factually incorrect”. “I have no issues with chief minister Amarinder Singh and if he ever will have any issue, I have full faith in the chief minister and all my grievances would be resolved on priority basis. I meet the CM at least twice a week and he always encourages me for carrying out development works in Gill constituency. Moreover, if any other MLA has any issues with the CM, they can be resolved with discussion,” hesaid.

Vaid thanked the CM, saying that maximum number of funds for repair and new roads had been granted to Gill constituency and the CM had always assured maximum funds for the development of his constituency. He said the CM was like family to him and he could never go against him.

JAIPUR: Referring to the current protest going on in various parts of the country regarding the Citizenship Amendment Act, chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday asked police officers to be vigilant.

At a review meeting on law and order held at his residence, he directed police to arrest criminals conning common people through various fake advertisements and organised crime.

“Mafia working in bajri, land, drugs should be held on priority basis. Police must develop a network with the public to get first-hand information about these crimes. This will help police to catch the offenders early on initial stage,” directed Gehlot.

The meeting was attended by DGP Bhupendra Singh who said Jaipur police had started a drive against drugs.

On fake health advertisements published in various news portals and magazines that have become a most appropriate method to blackmail people, CM asked police to take action. “There are many responsible news organisations who do not run such advertisements which should be appreciated but those who are becoming a medium of exploitation of innocent, must be punished,” directed Gehlot.

Parties should shun communal politics &amp; work for economy: Shiv Sena,"MUMBAI: Expressing deep concern over the long-term economic repercussions of the Covid-19 crisis and the lockdown, the Shiv Sena on Saturday said that all political parties should stop playing communal politics in future and instead work towards bringing the economy back on track.

The party said the talks held between Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan recently over the impact of the Covid-19 shows how grave the crisis is for the economy. It said time has now come to grow wiser.

""Congress leader Rahul Gandhi held talks with economist Raghuram Rajan through digital medium. Rajan said that the government needs to spend Rs 65000 crore to help the poor facing hardships due to the coronavirus lockdown. He said the entire country will have to face the economic consequences of lockdown,"" the Sena said.

""Rajan said the government's present definition of the poor will change after lockdown. Middle class and upper middle class will also become poor and start demanding certificate of economic backwardness. Even a developed nation like the US is staring at a grave problem of unemployment.

""In the US, there is system of unemployment allowance, which India doesn't have. Rajan's observation is that 10 crore people in India will become jobless, which is a matter of concern,"" the party said.

Through their talks, one thing became clear that continuing lockdown for indefinite period will prove costly for the economy. The government will have to work beyond the set norms. Power and authority to take decisions cannot remain limited with only a couple of people, the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said.

As far as Maharashtra is concerned, the 2019-20 revenue income is Rs 3.15 lakh crore, while the expenditure is Rs 3.35 lakh crore. But due to lockdown the revenue deficit will grow and it would become difficult to run the state, it added.

""The central government will have to take everyone along. It will have to take into account others' views and chart out the road ahead,"" it said.

""In India, all political parties should work towards bringing the economy back on track, instead of playing politics of India-Pakistan, religion and caste. The prime minister should take a lead and the entire country will stand behind him,"" it said.

BENGALURU: Under pressure from the party’s old guard, chief minister BS Yediyurappa is said to have dropped the idea of appointing two more deputy chief ministers (DyCMs). He is also thinking of sacking at least two ministers from his cabinet to accommodate some upset loyalists besides the 11 victorious Congress-JD(S) rebel MLAs.

If Yediyurappa keeps his promise and allots cabinet berths to the 11 rebels who won the bypolls on BJP tickets, he would be left with only five vacancies for loyalists.

Some like health minister B Sriramulu are also reportedly upset as speculation suggests the CM could appoint newly elected Gokak MLA Ramesh Jarkiholi DyCM.

However, Sriramulu, who has been conspicuous by his absence at meetings, denied he was an aspirant for the post, or that he was unhappy that Jarkiholi would get it.

“I couldn’t attend cabinet meetings since my daughter’s wedding was fixed,” Sriramulu said. “I had taken the CM’s written permission.”

As for the DyCM post, he said, “Only god decides what to give us and what not to give. I believe people have given me enough love. I have no qualms if Ramesh Jarkiholi is given the DyCM post.”

Some also say Yediyurappa plans to convince the central leadership to do away with DyCM posts altogether so as to bring parity among senior leaders in his cabinet.

Party functionaries said the creation of two more DyCM posts will only create a rift in the party and may also divide the sizeable Valmiki community to which Sriramulu and Jarkiholi belong. This, the said, would weaken the BJP’s strong voter base.

"Focus on helping people, don’t play politics: BJP leader","COIMBATORE: Political parties must focus on giving hope to people at this time of pandemic rather than criticising the Centre, said BJP leader Pon Radhakrishnan on Wednesday through an online press meet.

Responding to questions about allegations of irregularities in purchasing rapid test kits and the lack of transparency in PM CARES fund, he said leaders of all political parties should focus on giving people hope at this juncture and not just criticize the Centre. “People have said the rapid test kits are faulty. We should focus on proper testing. Political leaders should focus on giving hope to people,” he said.

Responding to the allegations of non-transparency in PM CARES fund, he said the Modi government has been beyond corruption and its functioning is transparent. “Why are people criticizing it now? There is a time for doing politics, during elections. We shall talk then,” he said.

Commenting on the allegation that the Centre was biased in providing compensation to states, and Tamil Nadu not getting the amount it sought, he said as a Tamil, he wished the state gets more funds. “But the PM has been functioning by taking into account all problems and the possibility of future problems as well. He is not biased.”

On the complete lockdown in some corporations across the state, he said no government was experienced in handling such a pandemic and they were trying out things. “But the crowding of people in some areas the day before the complete lockdown could have been avoided,” he said.

Commenting on the controversy around actor Jyotika’s statement on temples being maintained well and schools and hospitals being neglected, Radhakrishnan said BJP gives importance to education. “We are affectionate towards Jyotika’s family. But she should have avoided the statement,” he said.

Karnataka: DK Shivakumar issues veiled threat to BS Yediyurappa on medical college,"This story is from December 8, 2019

DK Shivakumar

BENGALURU: Issuing a veiled threat to chief minister BS Yediyurappa, Congress’ DK Shivakumar on Saturday demanded he reconsider his decision to cancel the medical college and hospital project allotted to his constituency, Kanakapura, in Ramanagara district.

“I request you to order restoration of the allotment of medical college at Kanakapura and give a date for performing bhoomi puja... I will be constrained to resort to serious action in my own way to get justice to the people of Kanakapura...” Shivakumar wrote to the CM.

Accusing Yediyurappa of cancelling the project “overnight’’ under some presure, he said: “I was shocked to learn that your government, with a single-member cabinet took a decision to cancel it overnight and transfer/ reallot the same to Chikkaballapura” .

Shivkumar said the medical college and hospital in Kanakapura was included in the 2018-19 budget, which was also passed. The previous coalition government had allotted land. “I would like to reiterate that I have no objection whatsoever for allotment of medical college to Chikballapura.. but, my objection is to the cancellation of the medical college allotted to Kanakapura, that too when the establishment of it was at an advanced stage,” Shivakumar said.

BENGALURU: Rural development and panchayat raj minister KS Eshwarappa on Friday raised eyebrows by saying only those disqualified MLAs who win the bypolls will be made ministers, while the rest will have to work as ordinary party workers of the BJP.

His comments are contrary to chief minister BS Yediyurappa’s stand that the “sacrifice” made by the disqualified MLAs would be amply rewarded and that they could be made MLCs — albeit a difficult proposition — if they lose.

“Whoever wins the byelections will be made ministers,” Eshwarappa told reporters. “If all win, all will become ministers. But there is no question of making disqualified MLAs ministers if they lose the elections,” said Eshwarappa.

He also suggested the party was not in favour of fielding all disqualified MLAs, for fear of a backlash. “We had told them [disqualified MLAs] to take the [legislative] council route to become ministers. But they said they wanted to become MLAs and then ministers. We have honestly worked for their victory. But if they lose, they should not ask for any post or position. They will have to be party workers,” Eshwarappa said.

Asked if there would be resistance from ‘original’ and ‘loyal’ BJP legislators if all the disqualified MLAs were accommodated in the cabinet, Eshwarappa said: “The BJP came to power only because of the sacrifices of the disqualified MLAs and we need to protect their interests first.”

To a question, he said Laxman Savadi will continue as deputy chief minister even if three others — Ramesh Jarkiholi, Mahesh Kumatalli and Shrimant Patil — become ministers.

","“Whoever wins the byelections will be made ministers,” Eshwarappa told reporters.

Adnan Sami: Don't drag me into politics,"Singer Adnan Sami has lately been on a slamming spree against anyone who has questioned his Padma Shri win.

It was also pointed out that while Sami opted for an Indian citizenship only four years gao, his father is a Pakistani security force veteran who fought against India during the 1999 Kargil War.Sami has earlier declared that he shouldn't be held responsible for his father's action. Asked how he looked at the fact that Indian Muslims continue to be made accountable for what the Mughals and other Muslim invaders did to Hindus over centuries, he said: ""First of all, the best thing about history is that it's past, and it should be kept in the past because that's where it belongs. God gave us eyes to look forward and not backward. The most important thing is we should forget all that because nobody from that era is alive today to answer these questions -- least of all you (the media) and I, or anybody for that matter.""""Secondly, this is all about politics.

"Madhya Pradesh: Now, all eyes on bypolls to 25 seats, most belong to Jyotiraditya Scindia stronghold","Jyotiraditya Scindia

BHOPAL: If the BJP forms an alternative government in MP after the fall of Kamal Nath government on Friday, the state would witness by-polls on as many as 25 seats in less than six months.Among them, 22 have been vacated by the rebel Congress MLAs, most of them, supporters of rebel party leader Jyotiraditya Scindia and hailing from Gwalior-Chambal region, another seat fell vacant after the death of Jaura MLA Banwarilal Sharma, who too was a Scindia loyalist. Two seats held by the BJP also fell vacant - one due to death of Manohar Untwal and another after the Speaker accepted MLA Sharad Kol’s resignation. The party is contesting Kol’s resignation saying that he had given that resignation some months ago and had, later, withdrawn it.When asked whether there have been so many simultaneous by-elections in the state before, political observer, Girijashankar, said “No, it’s unprecedented and I have a feeling that it may be converted into a mid-term election by the next government. Who would like to have a vulnerable government. Even if the BJP is able to win 15 out of 25 seats, they won’t have a comfortable majority. It won’t be strange if the BJP leadership decides to recommend dissolution of the House to pave way for a fresh election. In fact, Kamal Nath should have done it the day after 17 of his MLAs went to Bengaluru,” he said.The 25 seats in question have a “mixed” history as far as results are concerned, but since the BJP had landslide victory in Madhya Pradesh over the past three elections before 2018 assembly election, when Congress came back to power, it seems to have upper edge over the rival Congress in these constituencies as everywhere else in the state.Congress, which has 23 of the 25 seats slated to go for by-polls as of now, had won only six of these seats in 2013 election and nine in 2008 election. BSP, which have had sizeable presence in Chambal and Vindhya region, has won 1 of these seats in 2013 and 2 in 2008 election.Nine of the 25 seats are reserved seats, 8 for SCs and one for STs. most of them have been seats of traditional rivalry.

‘BJP using issue for political gain’,"This story is from December 13, 2019

Malappuram: IUML leader P K Kunhalikkuty

said in New Delhi that Citizenship (Amendment) Bill (CAB) is against the fundamental principles of the Constitution, which upholds secularism. “It is first time in the history of India that people of a particular religion have been exempted from a law. The day the bill was passed is a black day for India,” he said.

Discrimination in the name of religion will pose a major threat to the country. People also would be discriminated for their colour, creed and their state, in future, he said.

Alleging that BJP is trying to use the issue for political gain, Kunhalikkutty said that he is hopeful that court will take a positive decision on the petition.

Meanwhile, the Popular Front of India (PFI) will organize ‘Justice Conference’ in Kozhikode on Friday. The meeting was initially organised to protest the Supreme Court verdict in the Ayodhya case. CMB will also be a topic after the recent developments. tnn

Uttar Pradesh: Politics all set to move beyond ‘BC’ era in state,"Representative Image

LUCKNOW: While virtual classrooms, work from home and video-conferencing are becoming new normal in the Covid-19 induced world, political parties can't remain untouched. Like all other professions, politics, too, is set to change drastically from what it was in before corona (BC) era.Now, it seems that the day is not far off when politicians would also start opting for digital speeches and conferences. As talks are already under way for reviving the economy by resuming commercial activities in a calibrated manner, political parties, too, have started devising ways to hold their activities, including indoor meetings as well as rallies, on a digital format. The future political activities will be more virtual and less physical.CM Yogi Adityanath recently held a virtual cabinet meeting through video-conferencing. Also, this has been his preferred mode to connect to officials across 75 districts of the state.""This new format will suit only those political parties which have well-oiled organisational machinery. The BJP with 65 swanky offices which are equipped with latest electronic gadgets and digital systems would definitely pose a major challenge to the cash-starved Congress on this front too,"" says a political observer. SP too, is on a better footing as it not only has adequate funds to update its functioning, but is also headed by a tech-savy national president Akhilesh Yadav who has already digitalised his party's Lucknow headquarters with a new auditorium having all modern systems. The SP is now focussing on upgrading its offices in small districts.SP MLC Udaibir Singh, a JNU passout, said: “Even after the lockdown we would have to follow social distancing norm. But this is not an easy task for a politician as he has to meet workers who approach him from far flung areas daily,” he said adding that “our president Akhilesh Yadav is in constant touch with technical advisors. He has started meeting office-bearers of district units via video-conferencing.” And the BSP is also not far behind. Its national president Mayawati is gradually passing the party legacy to tech friendly Akash Kumar who is trying to bring about the much needed change.Meanwhile, Ashutosh Mishra, who has written several books on political science, said, “Politicians cannot stop meeting their supporters and workers. Such meetings are part of their lives and they cannot change themselves overnight. They would have to learn how to make a balance between social distancing and social gatherings.”","Representative ImageLUCKNOW: While virtual classrooms, work from home and video-conferencing are becoming new normal in the Covid-19 induced world, political parties can't remain untouched.

BHOPAL: Over 15 months after he took over as the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, Kamal Nath resigned from the top post on Friday.His move comes a day after the Supreme Court directed that a floor test be conducted in Madhya Pradesh assembly to prove that the Congress government led by him enjoys majority in the House following the rebellion by 22 MLAs of his party.Madhya Pradesh political crisis live updatesNath submitted his resignation to governor Lalji Tandon at the Raj Bhawan here this afternoon.""He submitted his resignation to the governor,"" a Raj Bhawan official saidIn his resignation letter, Nath said, ""In my 40-year- long public life, I have always done politics of purity and valued democratic norms and given priority to it. But what transpired in the last two weeks is a new chapter of devaluation of democratic values.""In the letter, he also congratulated new chief minister of the state and said he will also extend help in the development of the state.Before submitting his resignation, Nath addressed a press conference, where he announced his resignation.During the press conference, he also accused the BJP of killing the democratic values by conspiring against his government and blamed former Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia for the current political crisis in the state.""I have decided to submit my resignation to the governor. But I will continue to work for the welfare of the people...I did the politics of value,"" he said.""I took over as the CM on December 17, 2018.

I was given an opportunity for a period of five years to give a new identity to the state,"" he said.""The BJP didn't like the people-centric works carried out by my government during our 15-month rule, so they kept conspiring against me,"" he said.Nath alleged that 22 Congress MLAs were held captive in Bengaluru by the BJP, which has been witnessed by the entire country.""BJP killed the democratic values by conspiring,"" he said.""I have proved my majority on the floor of the House several times during the past 15 years...but the BJP betrayed the people of the state by destabilising the government,"" he said.Nath mentioned the works carried out by his government during the last 15 months, including the farm loan waiver and development of cow shelters.""BJP betrayed the farmers by conspiring against me,"" he said, claiming that 400 promises made in the election manifesto were completed in 15 months.He said the BJP was afraid of the success of his government.Blaming Scindia for the ongoing political crisis in the state, Nath said ""BJP colluded with Maharaj (Scindia) for killing democracy and my government.""Earlier this month, Scindia quit the Congress and joined the BJP. Twenty-two Congress MLAs, who were loyal to him, had rebelled and resigned.On Thursday, the Supreme Court had ordered the Madhya Pradesh assembly speaker to conduct a floor test by 5 pm.After Speaker NP Prajapati accepted the resignation of 16 rebel Congress legislators on Thursday night, the Kamal Nath government was reduced to minority with 92-MLAs in the 230-members house. The resignations of six others had been accepted earlier.Similarly, the strength of the house also reduced to 222, trimming down the majority mark to 104.In this situation, the BJP has the majority mark with 107.On Friday morning, the speaker said that he has accepted the resignation of BJP MLA Sharad Kol (Beohari).But, Kol said that he had applied for withdrawing the resignation submitted earlier. This has further reduced the number of BJP MLAs to 106, but well above the majority mark in current strength.While the BSP has two members in the House, theSP has one.

MP Floor Test: Madhya Pradesh speaker accepts 16 rebels' resignations ahead of floor test,"Chief minister Kamal Nath in Bhopal on Thursday

Will seek legal opinion, says CM Kamal Nath, ahead of floor test

BHOPAL: Just before midnight on Thursday, and 17 hours before the floor test, Madhya Pradesh Speaker N P Prajapati accepted the resignations of 16 breakaway MLAs of the Jyotiriaditya Scindia faction.This means there will be 24 bypolls in Madhya Pradesh within six months, and fortunes may swing yet again regardless of how the floor test goes on Friday. Congress is left with 92 MLAs now to BJP's 107 in a reduced House strength of 206. CM Kamal Nath held a legislative party meet till nearly midnight and will meet the press at noon on Friday.""Today, the Supreme Court's verdict has come. We argued our case strongly. We strongly kept our side about the 16 MLAs kept in captivity. The apex court has directed that a floor test be conducted tomorrow. We are not disappointed. Even today we stand united,"" he told his MLAs.Accusing BJP of playing a ""dirty game by keeping Congress MLAs hostage in Bengaluru"", Nath said: ""BJP is disturbed by our people-friendly welfare schemes, which is why it tried to destabilise us. People are watching this. People gave us the mandate and made us responsible for the development of the state. BJP cannot accept this and that is why has been conspiring from the first day. Together, we will confront every challenge thrown by BJP.""Earlier in the day, Kamal Nath said he would take legal opinion. “We will study SC’s order and every aspect related to it, discuss with legal experts, take their advice, and then finalise our decision,” the CM tweeted.Both Congress and BJP have issued whip to their MLAs for Friday’s floor test. Voting will be by show of hands. With the death of two sitting MLAs and resignation of 22 rebel Congress legislators, the House strength now stands at 206, putting majority mark at 104. Even if all four allies (two from BSP, one from SP and four Independents) support Congress, it will still fall short of the magic figure. BJP has the upper hand.All 22 MLAs of the Scindia faction had resigned on March 10, and BJP gave the resignations to the Speaker the same day. Prajapati accepted the resignations of six ministers on March 14, and said the rest were “under his consideration”. On the eve of the floor test, he accepted them at one go. On Thursday, the lone Samajwadi Party MLA, Rajesh Shukla, of Bijawar has been issued a whip by his party to support Congress.BJP may have its own issues. It counts 107 MLAs but paraded 106 before the Governor on Monday. BJP MLA from Maihar Narayan Tripathi has been visiting CM Nath frequently and has repeatedly said the government is safe. The cabinet on Wednesday cleared his demand to carve Maihar into a district. Tripathi is one of the two BJP MLAs who supported the Congress government in the monsoon session last July.CM Nath has said that many of the 16 rebel MLAs and some BJP legislators are in contact with him.

Hong Kong political crisis deepens despite protest lull during virus,"Pro-democracy protesters react as police fire water cannons outside the government headquarters in Hong Kong i... Read More

HONG KONG: A roundup of Hong Kong pro-democracy activists and a row over the powers of Beijing's office in the city have deepened the political crisis engulfing the financial hub even as a coronavirus lockdown prevents large-scale protests.The mass demonstrations that convulsed the semi-autonomous Chinese city for seven straight months last year have dissipated during the COVID-19 crisis as cautious residents stick to social distancing.But over the past week, political tensions have soared once more, threatening to upend the calm in a city still ruptured by ideological divides and where many fear China's strengthening grip is eroding their freedoms.There is a ""new, gritty nastiness emerging"", risk management consultants Steve Vickers Associates warned in a note this week, and with neither Beijing nor the democracy camp willing to make compromises, future unrest was near inevitable.On Sunday, police arrested 15 prominent activists on charges linked to last year's demonstrations.Those detained were not masked protesters who often violently clashed with police, but rather some of the city's best-known moderates -- including former lawmakers, academics and a media tycoon.Among them was 81-year-old barrister Martin Lee, who in the 1980s helped draft the ""Basic Law"" -- the city's mini-constitution that grants liberties and a high degree of autonomy unseen on the Chinese mainland.The police swoop came during a row over whether Beijing was reinterpreting a key part of that document.The spat began when the Liaison Office -- which represents China's central government -- issued a statement condemning pro-democracy lawmakers for filibustering in the legislature.The office suggested the politicians had breached their oath of office and could be prosecuted.That sparked accusations that Beijing had crossed a line.While China's control over Hong Kong's foreign policy and defence is undisputed, Article 22 of the Basic Law forbids Beijing departments from ""interfering"" in areas where the city governs itself -- such as its legislature and separate judicial system.As criticism mounted, the Liaison Office made a landmark announcement: it was not governed by the provision -- even though documents previously submitted to Hong Kong's legislature stated it was.Instead, it argued it had a ""distinctive"" role and could exercise a ""supervisory power"" over the city.Hong Kong's government deepened the confusion when it issued a statement initially saying the Liaison Office was governed by Article 22, only to retract it hours later and issue two more corrected versions.The cabinet member whose office provided the advice for the initial statement was moved to a new position in a reshuffle on Wednesday, although city leader Carrie Lam denied it was linked to the furore.Critics seized on the move as the latest attempt by Beijing to increase control over Hong Kong's politics.The Progressive Lawyers Group called it ""brazen in its intention to tighten Beijing's grip on the city by unconstitutionally expanding the powers of the Liaison Office"".And the Bar Association published a legal analysis concluding there was ""no question"" Beijing's offices in the city were bound by the non-interference clause.Prominent activist Joshua Wong told AFP he believed China's leaders were taking advantage of the world being distracted by the pandemic.""Beijing in the upcoming future will just strengthen and enhance interference in Hong Kong local affairs,"" he said.Others disputed the idea that the Liaison Office crossed a legal rubicon.""Merely commenting and expressing one's view on a matter of public interest would not count as intervention,"" Simon Young, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong , told AFP.Jasper Tsang, a former president of Hong Kong's legislature and a pro-Beijing heavyweight, said the Liaison Office felt it had ""no choice"" but to wade into the paralysis in the legislature, which had left a dozen bills languishing for months.Opponents are filibustering to delay a bill outlawing insults to the Chinese national anthem -- a serious provocation to Beijing.Tsang said the Liaison Office would likely be more confrontational in future.""How can you stop it?"" he said.Expectations are now rising that last year's unrest will return, especially with legislative elections due in September, when the pro-democracy camp is hoping to score large gains.Beijing has also made it clear it wants Hong Kong to have a new national security law -- a proposal that sparked huge protests in 2003.Now, some dissidents have started calling for a protest on July 1 even if social distancing measures against the virus are still in place.""Businesses should prepare for further civil unrest, as the threat from the virus recedes and friction rises,"" said Steve Vickers Associates.","""Beijing in the upcoming future will just strengthen and enhance interference in Hong Kong local

From Hindutva posterboy to Uttar Pradesh CM with difference,"This story is from March 19, 2020

Repreentative Image

Looking back, the past three years flash images of a distinct style of functioning that contributed to build what political circles today refer to as ‘Brand Yogi’. The saffron robes on the stocky frame then are just a give-away, it seems.

It was 2017. Several villages in the state were marooned due to a heavy monsoon. Yogi Adityanath had a few months ago took charge as chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. While similar situations in the past would have a CM conducting an aerial survey, Yogi sailed in the rising waters on a rescue boat with the NDRF to visit flood-hit areas and distribute relief material.

It was made clear from the beginning that Yogi was going to transform the work culture of the state. He would be completely involved in the state’s issues and concerns, watching departmental presentations till as late as 1am, then next day calling up his principal secretaries to his office at 9am.

Yogi brought in the concept of ‘One district one product’ (ODOP), which shot up exports from the state to 35% at a time when the national average is actually dipping. The state today is looking at an investment of Rs 4.28 lakh crore, apart from a dedicated defence corridor to bring about a turnaround in the economics of a starving Bundelkhand. All this while, he continued taking a stand against corruption within the state machinery and suspended even IAS officers.

In the past three years, he appears to have assiduously cultivated “Brand Yogi”, which displays the confluence of Hindutva and good governance. Despite criticism from a quarter for aggressively pursuing the Hindutva ideology, donning saffron robes and using saffron towels, to saffronising even government buildings, to renaming cities, he went on to declare in the Assembly “Main Hindu hoon, Eid nahin manata” (I am a Hindu, I don’t celebrate Eid), bringing an end to the age-old practice of Roza Iftar at the CM residence.

He visited Ayodya 23 times in the past three years, organised a deepotsav in the temple town and drenched himself with a colourful Holi at Barsana. Overall, Yogi has never shied away from brandishing his no-compromise policy on Hindutva.

Embarking upon the Ganga Yatra passing through 29 districts and a complete ban on cow slaughter,Yogi has consolidated the RSS philosophy of “Gai, Ganga aur Geeta” elevating himself as the posterboy of Hindutva, triggering demands from across India for his public meetings and speeches.

Despite his best efforts to amalgamate Hindutva with development, there are hiccups, says a political analyst. First, the bureaucracy in UP is not used to the fast pace of work that he has set, he says, adding, “also he was an outsider in BJP when he took over as the CM and was not familiar with the 700-strong bureaucracy. That gap still exists.”

“His pro-police establishment stance has also been questioned, but he carries on nonchalantly. That’s the hallmark of Brand Yogi,” says an observer.

Indian-Americans seek to play increased role in US politics,"This story is from March 19, 2020

HYDERABAD: Ahead of his visit to India, Donald Trump retweeted a video from the film Baahubali with his head morphed instead of the actor Prabhas. He shared the video with the caption, “Look so forward to being with my great friends in INDIA!”.

While many saw the US president’s gesture as a curtain-raiser to his India trip, others felt this was his attempt to create a greater connection with Indian-Americans, especially Telugus, in an election year.

Analysts have been speaking about the potential of the Indian-American community in the US. In fact, student group North American Association of Indian Students (NAAIS) has recently started a #DesiVote campaign to get unregistered Indian-Americans to exercise their franchise.

NAAIS claims there are over two million unregistered Indian-American voters. Breaking down the number, Sudhanshu Kaushik, founder, NAAIS, said, “We found that there were about 4.5 million Indian-Americans in US in 2016, out of which 3.5 million people were above 18 years old. In 2018, 800,000 Indian-Americans came out to vote for the mid-term elections. Even if we round that figure to a million, it means there are definitely over two million voters who did not vote.”

The focus of the #DesiVote campaign are these eligible voters, said Kaushik, adding that while Indian-Americans play a huge role in the economic and social spheres in the US are, “Politically underepresented and at the same time are not going out to make our voices heard.”

Also speaking of the great demographic profile, Chinmayi Balusu, a NAAIS member, said, “I wanted to join the effort to mobilise Indian-Americans to register to vote. This would be the first step to exercising their political power.” As a first-time voter herself, she said the initiative would aim to help people find the resources to register.

Meanwhile, several India-Americans agreed they would like to see the community play a more proactive role. “We contribute majorly towards taxes and are educated, law abiding citizens. Better representation for us would mean better politics in the US,” said Suresh K, a resident of Dallas. Ramesh Reddy, from New Jersey, said he did not vote in the last presidential elections, but will this time. “I think every vote matters,” he said.

ATLANTA: Governors of about half a dozen US states pushed ahead on Tuesday with plans to partially reopen for business despite warnings by some health officials that doing so could trigger a new surge in coronavirus cases.The easing of sweeping restrictions in Georgia, South Carolina and other mostly Southern US states follows protests against rules imposed during the pandemic that shut down businesses and largely confined residents to their homes.A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed a majority of Americans believed stay-at-home orders should remain in place until public health officials determine lifting them is safe, despite the damage to the US economy.""It's a matter of concern, this whole idea of opening up. It's based on non-science generated parameters,"" Dr. Boris Lushniak, dean of the University of Maryland School of Public Health, told Reuters in an interview.Deaths from Covid-19 , the respiratory illness caused by coronavirus, topped 45,150 nationwide as cases climbed to over 810,000, according to a Reuters tally.New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Michigan each reported their highest single-day coronavirus-related death tolls - over 800 between the three states. New York state, the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, reported 481 new deaths.Governors are under pressure from businesses and some constituents to relax stay-at-home orders that have thrown over 20 million people out of work in the past month alone.In Wisconsin , Republican lawmakers who filed a lawsuit against Democratic Governor Tony Evers, challenging his stay-at-home order that runs until May 26.Tensions between US President Donald Trump, a Republican, and local officials have risen over the U.S. government's role in ramping up testing, which infectious disease experts say is key to enable a safe reopening.Those experts say the United States, with a population of nearly 330 million people, should test 3 million per week to get an accurate sense of the virus's reach. States have tested only a third of that number in the past seven days, according to the Covid Tracking Project.Even as states move ahead with plans to reopen, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned a second wave of the coronavirus could be worse if it coincides with the start of seasonal flu season.“There’s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through,” CDC Director Robert Redfield said in an interview with The Washington Post.Georgia is among a half dozen states that will allow more business activity this week or next.Brian Kemp, Georgia's Republican governor, will allow gyms, hair salons, bowling alleys, tattoo and massage parlors to reopen on Friday, followed by movie houses and restaurants next week.Kemp said his plan balances public health with the need to reignite the state's economy, saying social distancing rules would remain in place.Georgia has reported 174,000 positive cases and six deaths per 100,000 people, both below the national average, according to a Reuters analysis of data collected by the Covid Tracking Project.But the state also has one of the lowest testing rates, giving health officials less data on the reach of the illness to base decisions on reopening, the data showed.""Don't go out,"" Savannah Mayor Van Johnson, a Democrat, told residents of the eastern Georgia city during a news conference. ""People will not come here if they think our businesses are not safe.""New York Governor Andrew Cuomo emerged from a meeting with Trump at the White House and said the president had agreed to help his state procure chemical reagents and other supplies needed to double testing capacity.Cuomo said it was up to his state to help labs boost their testing capacity and to organize the workers needed to take more samples.""That is an intelligent division of labor,"" Cuomo said at a press briefing. ""Let each level of government do what it does best.""The governor said New York would try to double the number of people it tests each day - including diagnostic and antibody tests - to 40,000, characterizing the task as an ""enormous undertaking"" that would take weeks.Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom of California, the most populous U.S. state, said despite evidence the outbreak was slowing there, cases and deaths were still rising.Over the seven-day period ending on Sunday night, the number of deaths in California nearly doubled, and the number of new cases increased by nearly 50%, state data showed.Newsom promised to release a detailed plan for testing and reopening on Wednesday, but cautioned it was too soon to loosen public health restrictions.In Washington, D.C., the U.S. Senate unanimously approved $484 billion in additional coronavirus relief for the U.S. economy and hospitals treating patients sickened by the pandemic, sending the measure to the House of Representatives for final passage later this week.","""It's a matter of concern, this whole idea of opening up.

"Local political rivalry, drug peddlers behind Padarayanapura violence","View of Hosahalli road at Padarayanapura, two days after the incidence of violence (file photo)

BENGALURU: A fight for supremacy between local political rivals -- JD(S) councillor Imran Pasha and Congress functionary Altaf Khan — is said to have led to the attack on health workers and subsequent vandalism at Padarayanapura on Sunday. Altaf’s wife Seema represents the neighbouring Jagajeevanram Nagar ward in the BBMP council.

Some also suspect drug peddlers in the locality could have goaded the vandals.

Imran and Altaf have been at loggerheads since 1999. Both vied for supremacy in the area and Padaryanapura started witnessing bloody gang wars before the duo plunged into active politics. Imran followed in the footsteps of his father Arif Pasha, who was a BBMP councillor from Padarayanapura, and contested election in 2010. But Altaf was his stumbling block as he too was nursing political ambitions. While Altaf’s electoral bids remained unsuccessful, Imran won twice from Padarayanapura.

The sealing of Padarayanapura and Jagajeevanram Nagar, after they were identified as Covid-19 hotspots, worsened the rivalry, with both camps wanting to beat each other in helping the needy. “Group clashes between Imran and Altaf are nothing new. But it took a murky twist as the two camps competed to reach out to people. Unfortunately, it ended up with miscreants attacking health workers,” said MB Adinarayana, a social worker.

The imposing presence of Chamarajpet MLA BZ Zameer Khan, whose constituency covers both wards, further fuelled the rivalry, with the legislator seen to be partial towards Altaf. People of Padrayanapura had been complaining that ration kits were being diverted to Jagajeevanram Nagar.

Things came to a head on Sunday when Zameer and Altaf took charge of the funeral rites of the 65-year-old woman, who succumbed to Covid-19, ignoring Imran. “The people who attacked the health workers actually wanted to ask the authorities why Padarayanapura wasn’t getting food kits while they were going to Jagajeevanram Nagar. Meanwhile, some miscreants joined and started vandalism,” said a BBMP official, who was part of the team that went to Padarayanapura to escort primary and secondary contacts to a quarantine camp.

Zameer said it was a mess created by the rival camps aiming to score political brownie points. “I knew something is brewing and that’s why I asked the officials not to venture into the area after dark. We could have gone in the morning to ferry the contacts to quarantine. However, my statement was misconstrued,” said Zameer.

Some also feel the violence was stage-managed by drug peddlers, who were upset about Padarayanapura being sealed off.

“The Congress party has taken note of all dimensions of the incident. We will take Zameer’s account before deciding on the next course of action,” said KPCC working president Saleem Ahmad.

Meanwhile, senior police officials met leaders of both camps and warned them against such incidents in future.

Politics in the time of coronavirus as TMC questions Centre’s intent,"NEW DELHI: Even before the war against Corona is far from over, a full scale political battle has broken out between the BJP-ruled Centre and the Trinamool Congress-ruled West Bengal government, sparked off by the “unannounced” landing of central team of officials in Kolkata on Monday morning.With West Bengal chief minister and TMC chief, Mamata Banerjee , reading the move as an affront to federal norms of governance, the TMC has accused the Centre of “playing politics at a time when states and the Centre are expected to work together to combat Corona.Addressing the media, Banerjee shot off a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bring the issue of “breaking federal norms” to his notice, on Monday evening.On Tuesday, TMC parliamentary leaders Sudip Bandopadhyay and Derek O’Brien questioned “the intent of the Centre,” while asking, “why Opposition-ruled states like Bengal are being put on targeted watch when BJP-ruled states like Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh or even states like Tamil Nadu and Telengana ruled by friendly parties, with high rise in Corona-positive cases were not being monitored by the Centre.""""Centre should clearly say why the central has come, then there should be no problem if there is no ill intention behind this,” said Bandopadhyay, when asked why the state government was outraged by the move.“Unfortunately when Bengal and all the other states are fighting Corona, the Centre is fighting the states,” said O’Brien, alleging that the Centre refused to call off Budget session (of Parliament) and delayed a lockdown when the virus was spreading, paying no heed to TMC’s warning on social distancing to be observed, apparently to install a BJP government in Madhya Pradesh.“It is a health emergency.

Don't want to meet Digvijaya Singh: Madhya Pradesh Congress rebel MLAs,"This story is from March 18, 2020

MLA Govind Singh Rajput (Image credit: Twitter)

BENGALURU: Rebel Congress MLAs from Madhya Pradesh who are staying at a resort here, on Wednesday said they have come to the city voluntarily and don't want to meet anybody, even as senior party leader Digvijaya Singh is making efforts to reach out to them.

High drama unfolded this morning near the resort, as Singh, a two-time Madhya Pradesh chief minister, staged a protest accusing the police of not allowing him to meet the legislators, following which he was detained briefly and released later.

Singh, along with Karnataka Congress chief D K Shivakumar, is meeting police top brass seeking opportunity to meet the MLAs.

He hit out at Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa, accusing them of trying to block their efforts to get in touch with the legislators.

""We have come here voluntarily on our own wish; we have got to know from some people that a few leaders from Madhya Pradesh including Digvijaya Singh and some MLAs have come here. We don't want to talk to anybody,"" Congress rebel MLA from Sumawali Adal Singh Kansana said in a video message.

""We have tried enough to speak with every one for the last one year, when they did not hear us for one year, what they will hear us in one day? We want to say only this that we have come here as per our wish and go back as per our wish,"" he added.

Another rebel MLA Govind Singh Rajput too said they have come voluntarily and don't want to meet anybody.

""We got to know that Digvijaya Singh has come with a few ministers and leaders. Unnecessarily at the gate they are saying they want to meet us. When no MLA wants to meet him, they should not be doing this. All MLAs have sent in their resignation,"" he said in a video message.

Currently, 22 rebel MLAs are said to be camping in the city.

Digvijaya Singh said he wants to meet MLAs, who are his ""voters"" for the Rajya Sabha polls in Madhya Pradesh, and will stay here till he meets them.

Ahead of meeting the city police commissioner, he said, ""I have my doubts (about any help from the commissioner) because of pressure from Union Home Minister and the chief minister on them; they will not allow meeting (MLAs), because if MLAs meet me they will come out with me.""

Claiming that Singh had come to the city, as he got a message from few rebel MLAs, Shivakumar asked: ""Why is police blocking, they don't have any right to block, they are blocking the right of a candidate.""

""Our candidate (Singh) wants to request the higher authorities (Police Commissioner), because these people (local police) are acting on the instructions of the Chief Minister here, so they want to request the higher authorities, then we will see other remedies,"" he added.

Shivakumar alleged Yediyurappa did not show the courtesy of responding to Singh's call.

""He (Singh) tried to request the chief minister; chief minister did not come on phone. No basic courtesy to answer senior leaders call...,"" he added.

In a massive setback for the Congress, its prominent youth leader Jyotiradtya Scindia quit the party and in a coordinated rebellion last week 22 MLAs loyal to him resigned in Madhya Pradesh, pushing the 15-month-old Kamal Nath government to the brink of collapse.

Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath

BHOPAL: With senior Congress leaders, including Digvijaya Singh and five ministers arrested in Bengaluru, chief minister Kamal Nath on Wednesday said he may head for the southern city that has been one of the focal points of the Madhya Pradesh political crisis that started a fortnight ago.

“BJP is killing democracy in Madhya Pradesh. BJP is nervous about bringing our 16 MLAs to the state. What is the crisis in one person meeting the legislators? In 15 months, we have proved majority and faced floor-test several times. If need be, I will also go to Bengaluru,” Nath said around noon on Wednesday.

This was preceded by a barrage of tweets at BJP and former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan . “It is entirely dictatorial to stop, misbehave and forcefully arrest Digvijaya Singh, Congress ministers and MLAs who went to meet their party legislators held captive by BJP in Bengaluru,” said Nath.

“The entire country is seeing how BJP is murdering democratic values to destabilise an elected government. Why are we not being allowed to meet the MLAs? After all what is BJP afraid of? A dirty game is being played by BJP in the state,” was his next.

Democratic values, constitutional values and rights are being suppressed, the CM alleged, adding: “Our arrested leaders should be released soon and allowed to meet the hostage MLAs.”

Attacking BJP, CM Nath tweeted, “BJP does not have majority right now, neither has Shivraj Singh Chouhan been elected leader of the BJP Legislative Party. BJP government has not been formed, neither will it be formed. But Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s urgency and restlessness to become chief minister is seen by the entire state.”

The CM’s final tweet in this volley said: “How they are getting restless for power! They are sleepless, day-dreaming of becoming chief minister. They are threatening officials. I pity their condition.”

Nitin Raut: BJP government has left Maharashtra under huge debt,"This story is from December 3, 2019

Nitin Raut

Newly appointed minister in chief minister Uddhav Thackeray's cabinet, Nitin Raut , on Monday launched an all-out attack against the previous BJP government led by Devendra Fadnavis , accusing it of pushing the state under a huge debt burden of Rs 6.7 lakh crore. Interacting with the media on his first visit to his hometown, the four-time North Nagpur MLA questioned Fadnavis's role following allegations by BJP MP Anantkumar Hegde that the ex-CM had diverted a Rs 40,000 crore grant back to the Centre.

Raut, who is one of the two Congress ministers to be inducted into the state cabinet, said when an MP makes such statements there must be ""something fishy"". ""Fadnavis must explain why the huge funds of Rs 40,000 crore meant for farmers' welfare were returned to the Centre. He seems to have done it during his 80-hour stint as a CM and people will definitely seek answers from him.""

Raut said that the Thackeray government would make all efforts to develop Vidarbha region.

"USA Coronavirus News: Some US producers, states reopening amid political pressure","SEATTLE: Boeing and at least one other US heavy-equipment manufacturer resumed production and some states rolled out aggressive reopening plans Monday, despite nationwide concerns there is not enough testing yet to keep the coronavirus from rebounding.In one of the most forceful moves yet, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp announced that gyms, hair salons, bowling alleys and tattoo parlors were among businesses that could reopen Friday, as long as owners followed strict social distancing and hygiene requirements.Boeing said it was putting about 27,000 people back to work this week building passenger jets at its Seattle-area plants, with virus-slowing precautions in place, including face masks and staggered shifts. Doosan Bobcat, a farm equipment maker and North Dakota’s largest manufacturer, announced the return of about 2,200 workers at three factories around the state.The reopenings came amid economic gloom, as oil futures plunged below zero on Monday and stocks and Treasury yields also dropped on Wall Street. The cost to have a barrel of US crude delivered in May plummeted to negative $37.63. It was at roughly $60 at the start of the year.Elsewhere around the world, step-by-step reopenings were underway in Europe, where the crisis has begun to ebb in places such as Italy, Spain and Germany. Parts of the continent are perhaps weeks ahead of the US on the infection curve of the virus, which has killed about 170,000 people worldwide, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.Businesses that start operating again in the US are likely to engender good will with the Trump administration at a time when it is doling out billions in relief to companies. But the reopenings being announced are a drop in the bucket compared with the more than 22 million Americans thrown out of work by the crisis.In a dispute that has turned nakedly political, President Donald Trump has been agitating to restart the economy, singling out Democratic-led states and egging on protesters who feel governors are moving too slowly.In several states, governors of both parties said they had seen signs that the coronavirus curve was flattening, making it possible to start reopening businesses and public spaces.Kemp said a decline in emergency room visits by people with flu-like symptoms indicated that infections were going down. But he also acknowledged that Georgia had lagged in COVID-19 testing and announced new initiatives to ramp it up.Texas on Monday began a week of slow reopenings, starting off with state parks, while officials said that later in the week, stores would be allowed to offer curbside service. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee announced Monday that businesses across most of the state would begin reopening as early as next week, although the order did not cover counties with the largest cities, including Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville and Chattanooga. Both states are led by Republicans.Republican West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said Monday that he would allow hospitals to begin performing elective procedures if the facilities met an unspecified set of criteria, while Democratic Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said Monday that he would let his statewide stay-at-home order expire next week as long as strict social distancing and other individual protective measures continued.But governors from many other states said they lacked the testing supplies they need and warned they could get hit by a second wave of infections, given how people with no symptoms can still spread the disease.""Who in this great state actually believes that they care more about jet skiing than saving the lives of the elderly or the vulnerable?"" Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer remarked, referring to restrictions in place in her state. ""This action isn’t about our individual right to gather. It’s about our parents’ right to live.""Trump took to Twitter to complain that the ""radical left"" and ""Do Nothing Democrats"" are ""playing a very dangerous political game"" by complaining about a testing shortage. At the same time, Vice President Mike Pence told governors that Washington is working around-the-clock to help them ramp up testing.The death toll in the US stood at more than 40,000 — the highest in the world — with over 750,000 confirmed infections, by Johns Hopkins’ count. The true figures are believed to be much higher, in part because of limited testing and difficulties in counting the dead.","The cost to have a barrel of US crude delivered in May plummeted to negative $37.63.

MP political crisis: SC seeks response of MP govt on Shivraj Singh Chouhan's plea seeking floor test,"This story is from March 17, 2020

Supreme Court of India

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has asked the Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh to give by Wednesday its response to former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan 's plea seeking a direction for an immediate floor test in the assembly.

A bench headed by Justice D Y Chandrachud on Tuesday said it will issue notice to the state government and others, including the secretary of the legislative assembly, for tomorrow at 10.30am.

Chouhan and nine other BJP lawmakers, including the leader of opposition in the state assembly, moved the Supreme Court on Monday just after Speaker N P Prajapati cited coronavirus concerns and adjourned the house till March 26 without taking the floor test, apparently defying Governor Lalji Tandon's directions.

Appearing for the senior BJP leader and three-time chief minister, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said: ""the rationale, in this case, is that a floor test is required and usually the other side appears in such cases"".

Taking note of the submission, the bench said, ""We will have to issue a sought notice and keep it for tomorrow morning.""

The bench then took note of the submission of senior advocate Maninder Singh appearing for 16 rebel Congress MLAs that they be also allowed to become parties to Chouhan's petition.

Singh said 22 Congress MLAs have resigned from the assembly and the resignations of six lawmakers have already been accepted.

He said the remaining 16 MLAs also want their resignations to be accepted.

The bench granted Chouhan the liberty to serve the copy of the petition to the state government, speaker and others through e-mail besides traditional modes of service notice.

The three-time chief minister alleged in his plea that Nath is making all possible attempts to convert ""his minority government into a majority by giving all possible threats, allurements to the members of the Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha"".

He claimed the speaker, the chief minister and the principal secretary of the assembly have ""flagrantly violated the constitutional principles and have deliberately and willfully defied the directions"" of the governor asking the government to prove the majority on the floor of the house on March 16 when the budget session was to commence.

The plea said a floor test is constitutionally imperative because the Nath government in the state has been reduced to a minority on account of lack of confidence and the resignation of 22 Congress MLAs.

""It is becoming clear every day that the chief minister is fully conscious that he has lost confidence of 22 MLAs belonging to his own party and reduced to minority and he does not wish to face floor test unless and until he gets an opportunity to either pressurise them or purchase them to vote in his favour,"" said the petition.

It also referred to the recent Maharashtra political crisis in which the top court had ordered the floor test within 24 hours.

On Saturday night, the Madhya Pradesh governor wrote to Nath asking him to seek a trust vote in the assembly soon after the governor's address on Monday, saying his government was in a minority.

After the speaker accepted the resignation of six Congress MLAs on Saturday, the party now has 108 legislators.

These include 16 rebel legislators who have also put in their papers but their resignations are yet to be accepted.

The BJP has 107 seats in the House, which now has an effective strength of 222, with the majority mark being 112.

","Appearing for the senior BJP leader and three-time chief minister, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said: ""the rationale, in this case, is that a floor test is required and usually the other side appears in such cases"".

Politics heat up on drive against encroachments,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Nagpur: Politics is heating up over Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) drive against encroachments . Congress corporators Praful Gudadhe and Kamlesh Chaudhary have demanded an end to the action, terming it against the bylaws, while mayor Sandip Joshi said it would continue as it is legal, and is as per the high court order.

NMC discontinued the drive against vegetable markets on footpaths and roads on Monday and Tuesday, after two days of action on Saturday and Sunday, after municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe left for Mumbai for official meetings. In the last two days, vendors earlier selling vegetables and fruits by encroaching on footpaths and roads have returned as hawkers, selling produce on hand-carts.

Joshi had framed a policy for continuous action against all types of encroachments. He also approved formation of enforcement squads in all ten zones. Through the general body, he also approved a new policy to levy hefty penalties and take action against encroachers.

After assuming charge, Mundhe had directed officials of zone, market, health, enforcement departments and nuisance detection squad (NDS) to take action against encroachments, especially vegetable, fruit and meat markets running outside of designated places. Action was taken against 62 markets in all ten zones on Saturday and Sunday.

On Monday and Tuesday, vendors returned and were seen selling produce in the same spots, especially at Khamla, Mahal, Gokulpeth, Jaffar Nagar etc. Only difference was that NMC had demolished sheds and temporary shops.

Mundhe is in Mumbai since Monday morning and likely to return on Wednesday.

Only NMC Hanuman Nagar Zone conducted the drive on Tuesday and demolished 128 encroachments on footpaths and roads under the guidance of assistant commissioner Raju Bhivgade.

NMC sources told TOI vendors are adapting, and have turned into hawkers to avoid action. “Earlier, they used to sell vegetables, fruits etc by erecting temporary shops. Now, they are selling it on hand-carts, which brings them under the policy related to hawkers,” sources said.

Gudadhe and Chaudhary said in a press conference they will stop action against hawkers by showing provisions in the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation Of Street Vending) Act-2014. “The ongoing drive is illegal and against the Act. NMC cannot seize materials, hand-cart and levy fine on hawkers. As per the Act, NMC formed Town Vending Committee, which has been submitted to state government for approval. The committee has to conduct survey, register hawkers, develop hawking and no-hawking zones. Action can be taken against hawkers only if they sell outside of hawking zones. We will meet guardian minister Nitin Raut and request for a stay on the action,” he said.

Gudadhe added, the drive is also anti-public as it deprives people of convenient purchase of day-to-day commodities. “There are no designated markets, so existing ones are running for years,” he said.

Gudadhe also said the policy framed by the general body to levy hefty penalties also can be brought into effect only after completing process as per the Act.

In reply, Joshi said, “I am with the people of this city and not encroachers. Maximum people selling vegetables etc by encroaching on footpaths and roads are from out of the city. Even people want action against these encroachments. We are not taking action against hawkers. Action is being taken against encroachers as directed by HC to free footpaths and roads from encroachments,” he said.

Joshi said he was ready to hold ‘Walk and Talk With Mayor’ with vendors in the presence of Gudadhe and Mundhe. “Traffic congestion and accidents are rising due to encroachments. Also, encroachments cause unhygienic conditions,” he said.

Shockingly, NMC administration is yet to implement policy framed last month to levy hefty penalty and take stringent action against encroachments. NMC officials said policy was pending with civic chief for approval.

Govt doing politics of divert and rule: Congress,"This story is from February 4, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Tuesday hit back at the government in Rajya Sabha over the CAA and the NRC, saying it has created these ""destructive"" issues to divert attention from key challenges like economic slowdown, farm distress and unemployment.

""Triple Talaq, CAA, NPR issues are being talked about by you to divert attention on key issues of unemployment, black money, slow GDP growth.

""Your ideas or proposals are not constructive but destructive,"" Leader of the opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said in a discussion on Motion of Thanks on the President's Address.

Azad also expressed the hope that the government would soon realise its ""mistake"" of bifurcating Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories and bring a bill in this session to restore its statehood.

He was of the view that had the government brought constructive proposals, the opposition would have supported them all through.

As in Lok Sabha, the BJP on Tuesday launched a frontal attack on opposition parties specially Congress for their stance against the amended Citizenship Act saying they were trying to divide the nation.

Initiating the debate, senior BJP leader Bhupender Yadav accused the Congress and the Aam Adami Party of giving ""moral support"" to Shaheen Bagh anti-CAA protest.

Azad retorted: ""Shaheen Bagh is your creation. You want to run the government, and at the same time play role of opposition and come down on streets also to protest against all issues.""

He held the government responsible for not holding of discussions on issues like GDP growth slowdown, rising inflation and recent hike in levies on products like refrigerator, TV, AC, medical equipment, automobiles, tyres etc.

Azad alleged that the government is not doing enough for the modernisation of defence and highlighted the latest CAG report which flagged many issues related to it.

He said that the government cannot keep on abusing neighbouring countries and needs to modernise the defence.

The Congress leader alleged that government's decision of demonetisation led to job loss and there was poor implementation of GST.

He also criticised the government for the way it brought the bill to bifurcate Jammu and Kashmir state into two union territories and scrapped its special status.

He told the House that government reports indicate that on a total 114 parameters related to education, health, education, sanitation and food, Jammu and Kashmir's performance was better on 80 indicators than national average.

He said Gujarat scored better on 52 parameters than national average and if performance was the criteria then there are many states which need to reconstituted.

Azad appealed to the government to release all political leaders in the Valley. He claimed the bifurcation of the state has caused loss to industry, agriculture and employment.

""I hope that the government would admit its mistake and bring fresh bill to make Jammu and Kashmir a state,"" he said.

He also alleged that no minister tried to understand the issue and the government ""is on warpath"".

He demanded strict action against those MPs and legislators who gave off the cuff remarks on Citizenship Amendment Act, National Population Register and other issues.

He was of the view that since the government ""does not take action"" against the errant MPs and MLA, it raises doubt on its intentions.

Earlier, as many as 477 amendments to the Motion of Thanks were listed in the House.

During the discussion, Congress leader Kapil Sibal intervened and told the House that he did not make any statement in the court which was referred to by BJP leader Bhupender Yadav while initiating the debate.

Contesting the claim, Yadav said that there are newspaper clippings which would be tabled in the House.

Sibal said that he is denying the statement attributed to him by Yadav.

Assault case politically motivated: Shelke,"This story is from December 6, 2019

Nagpur: A day after a non-cognizable offence was registered against Congress corporator Bunty Shelke for allegedly thrashing a man, he claimed that the case was politically motivated to malign his image in public.

Kotwali police have registered a case of assault against Shelke for thrashing one Monty Mutkare. Shelke narrated his version of the incident during a press conference at Patrakar Bhavan on Thursday.

The corporator claimed that Monty is like a younger brother to him and on Tuesday night he was trying to give him ‘brotherly advice’ to not to indulge in anti-social activities. “I have known Monty for several years. I had several times conveyed my concerns about Monty’s drinking habits to his father and the bad company he has fallen into,” said Shelke.

Shelke claimed that he had gone to speak to Monty on Tuesday night after returning from a hospital. “Reports in newspapers that I was inebriated are wrong. In fact, I am a teetotaller. Even the CCTV footage at the spot shows that I was only speaking to Monty,” he said.

When asked about the allegation that he tried to “manage” the police, Shelke said, “There are 79 cases against me and that clearly shows the cops’ “affection” towards me.” The assault case is politically motivated as some BJP leaders are trying to malign my image, Shelke alleged.

Chief minister Kamal Nath (File Image)

BHOPAL: Chief minister Kamal Nath on Saturday shot a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah, asking for the safe return of the 22 Congress MLAs before budget session starts in the state assembly on March 16. “My request to you is to utilize your powers as Union home minister and securely bring back the 22 imprisoned Congress MLAs so they may do their duties as legislators without fear or allurement,” CM wrote.

In the letter, Nath gave a detailed account of how the state BJP was poaching on Congress alliance MLAs from March 3. “Through this letter, I want to draw your attention to the incidents that started from march 3, when three Congress MLAs, BSP’s Rambai and one independent MLA were taken to a hotel situated in Manesar, Gurugram,” CM Nath wrote. “At the right time, two ministers reached the hotel and released Mrs Rambai and her family members from the captivity of BJP leaders,” he explained.

The chief minister said that three Congress MLAs and one independent were taken to Bangalore in a chartered plane. He alleged that BJP MLA Arvind Bhadoria and party office-bearer Ashish Tiwari were mentioned in the list of passengers and they took the Congress legislators to Bangalore.

CM’s letter also stated that three chartered planes flew more Congress MLAs to Bangalore and 19 MLAs were lodged in a resort there. Former BJP minister Uma Shankar Gupta, former MLA Sudarshan and former MP Hemant Khandelwal went along with them. “Over time, the numbers have now grown to 22 and are under the protection of the Bangalore police. Photographs show some BJP leaders with these MLAs. All expenditure is being borne by the Karnataka BJP ,” CM Nath alleged.

Kamal Nath said he has information that all means of communication have been taken away from them and the MLAs are being held captive. He also narrated the incident when Narayan Choudhary, father of MLA Manoj Choudhary was not allowed to meet his own son when he reached the resort in Bangalore. He argued that the photographs and videos released of these MLAs reveal that they are being pressurized to behave and speak in a certain manner.

“You will agree that there is reason of a floor test if 22 MLAs are being held hostage outside the state,” CM Nath wrote. “It is an unprecedented situation when on one hand, the BJP is asking for floor test and on the other, holding many Congress MLAs captive,” he added.

""Lockdown protocol has to be thoroughly implemented to ward off #coronavirus. Police and administration @MamataOfficial failing to effect 100% #SocialDistancing or curbing religious congregations be shown door,"" Dhankhar tweeted.

""Lockdown must succeed-examine central para forces requisitioning!"" the governor added.

The governor's remarks did not go down well with the chief minister, who smelt politics in them.

""Why do we need paramilitary forces? There have been instances where military personnel themselves have been infected with the virus. Some people are trying to fish in troubled waters. I would urge everybody this is not the time for politics. This is a crisis situation,"" Banerjee said, but did not name the governor.

The Union Home Ministry had also recently flagged ""gradual dilution"" of the lockdown in some parts of the state.

Most of these localities are minority-dominated, and the state BJP unit has repeatedly alleged that lockdown was not being properly enforced in these areas.

The home ministry also said despite the Centre issuing orders from time to time under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, these were not being followed.

Reacting to the Centre's letter, Banerjee had said the Union government was only interested in ""extra vigilance in some specific areas"".

""We are not fighting any communal virus, we are fighting a disease spreading through human contact. Wherever we find any problem, steps will be taken to ensure that the lockdown is imposed there, but that doesn't mean shops would remain closed... We are keeping a close watch,"" she had said.

Dhankhar has been at loggerheads with the state government over a host of issues ever since taking office in July last year.

Bengaluru: Rebel Congress MP MLAs drop plan to return to Bhopal,"This story is from March 14, 2020

Congress workers waiting for the arrival of rebel party MLAs from Bengaluru jostle with police at Bhopal airp... Read More

BENGALURU: About 23 Madhya Pradesh Congress legislators, who were expected to fly to Bhopal on Friday to meet speaker NP Prajapati, cancelled their trip at the last minute for reasons unknown.

The rebel MLAs, who were holed up at a resort on the outskirts of Bengaluru, were expected to land in Bhopal as the speaker had issued notices asking them to appear before him and clarify if they'd quit voluntarily or under pressure.

The 15-month-old Kamal Nath government has been facing deep crisis following the resignation of 23 Congress MLAs after former Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia quit the party and joined BJP.

Police officials monitoring security arrangements of the legislators said the politicians left the resort on Friday morning in a bus towards the airport, but returned after two hours. Congress insiders said the rebel MLAs decided to stay back on instructions from a senior BJP leader, who arrived in Bengaluru to attend an RSS conclave. This, they alleged, was done after some MLAs showed inclination to withdraw their resignations (submitted to the speaker) and return to the Congress fold.

There are reports that the rebel legislators may be flown to Delhi on Saturday on a chartered aircraft and taken to a hotel in Gurgaon. Of the rebels, six are ministers in the Kamal Nath government.

“I was asked to pick up all 19 MLAs at the airport on their arrival from Bengaluru. However, I am leaving the airport after reports that their arrival has been postponed,” said a senior BJP state functionary, adding that the 19 legislators had arrived at Bengaluru airport but returned to the resort.

COIMBATORE: Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) members on Wednesday petitioned the office of city police commissioner, seeking action against a private company located at Ganapathy that duped several people of lakhs of rupees by promising them jobs abroad.

Vignesh Sakthivel, an engineering graduate from Kallakurichi, said, “About a year ago, I approached the company after seeing an advertisement. Initially, it said I need not pay any money until I clear an international standardized test for English language proficiency.”

But later, the firm started demanding money from him. “I have paid about Rs4 lakh to the firm so far. Initially, the company promised me to get a job in Australia and then offered a job in Poland.”

An engineering graduate with no prior experience, Sakthivel said the company had created fake experience certificate for him to obtain work permit in Poland. “The company submitted only higher secondary certificates. When asked, it said it always followed the same procedure.”

Despite attending visa interview twice, his application was rejected. “When I sought the money back, they started to threaten me,” he said.

PMK member Ashok Srinidhi said they had come across close to six people who were cheated by the company, which had been using the names of ruling party members to threaten them. “We have submitted a petition to police officials seeking immediate action against the company. Police have assured to look into the issue,” he said.

Manohar Lal Khattar congratulates Ranbir Gangwa on becoming deputy speaker

CHANDIGARH: Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Tuesday called upon all public representatives to follow basic tenets of the Constitution of India and raise the demand of their constituency in the House for the welfare of people of the state.

Khattar stated this during the one-day special session organized to commemorate the Constitution Day. He presented the 'Government Resolution Letter' in the House on the occasion. He read out the list of fundamental duties.

""Right is duty well performed. Right is the right discharge of duty,"" he said adding that it is a bitter truth that since Independence, the basic rights in our country have been emphasized much more than the basic duties. Initially, it was also necessary, but now the time has come that all the citizens of India should strictly follow their basic duties to further strengthen our democracy, he added.

The CM made the House aware that with a view to make the people of the state, especially younger generation, familiar with fundamental duties, an awareness campaign would be run from Tuesday till April 14, 2020, the 129th birth anniversary of Bhim Rao Ambedkar.

Maharashtra politics rings loud in Haryana House,"This story is from November 27, 2019

CHANDIGARH: Called to commemorate the 70th anniversary of adoption of the Constitution of India, the special session of the Haryana assembly turned into routine mudslinging match between the treasury and opposition benches in the House. With the incumbent BJP-JJP coalition on one side and the opposition Congress on the other, barbs were exchanged over political developments unfolding in Maharashtra at present and Emergency days of mid-1970s.

Of all the MLAs in the 90-member House, only chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Nangal Chaudhary MLA Rao Abhay Singh, Ambala City MLA Aseem Goel and Jhajjar MLA Geeta Bhukkal spoke without taking pot shots at political rivals. They restricted their speeches to contribution of the people from Haryana in the making of the Constitution of India.

Congress’s Kiran Choudhry was the first to trigger heated debate by stating that provisions of the Constitution were thrown to the winds for political interests in Maharashtra. She said BJP had done similar things in Goa, Arunachal Pardesh, Bihar and Uttranchal to form its governments.

She was countered by home minister Anil Vij with mention of incidents of 1975 when Indira Gandhi had imposed Emergency on the country and of 1982 when Bhajan Lal quietly took oath as chief minister by breaking away MLAs from Devi Lal’s Lok Dal party.

Speaker Gian Chand Gupta had to rise from his chair to pacify both the sides.

Vij, however, went on saying to Congress leaders, “Why are you people trying to cover up these mistakes.” Choudhry too continued to assert that she stood by her statement.

Finally, CM Khattar had to remind the MLAs of the solemn occasion to restore peace in the House. “We too have number of such issues to be taken up. But, let the special session be dedicated to special cause and we should take certain resolves,” he said.

However, minutes after BJP MLA from Hisar Kamal Gupta again turned the debate political. “It is only due to the provision of the Constitution that a tea vendor has become the prime minister and those born in the families of prime ministers are deprived of the opportunity by the electorate,’’ said Gupta, triggering further arguments.

"Punjab: Discontent brewing in ruling party, again","This story is from November 27, 2019

Congress

JALANDHAR: Less than three months of the appointment of six MLAs as the chief minister’s advisers with the cabinet rank to tackle the brewing discontentment within the Congress legislature party (CLP), voices of dissent are again emanating from the legislators’ group. What’s more, this time these voice seem more open and embarrassing for the Congress leadership.

After the state tackled floods in some parts and later the celebrations for the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev, old issues and discontentment are raising head again in the party. Congress MLAs are also wary that with little progress in the Bargari sacrilege incident, any development related to the issue would again bring it back to the centre stage with the Punjab government having little to explain in its defence.

Trouble within the CLP and party circles had started brewing just after the parliamentary elections in May. The signs of discontentment had come out during the assembly session in August as chief minister Amarinder Singh had to face some plain speak from the minsters and some MLAs, which was earlier unthinkable.

Punjab was one of the few states in the country where the Congress managed to retain its ground in the Lok Sabha polls. However, within six months the state government is in news due to wrong reasons.

Amid the discontentment, MLAs had started organizing themselves. In the last week of August, a meeting of around a dozen MLAs had also taken place at the residence of one legislator in Chandigarh in which they discussed the political situation and expressed their concern that the party was losing perception battle despite winning eight of the 13 Lok Sabha seats.

It was amid such developments that CM’s camp diffused the developing political crisis by appointing six advisers in the second week of September and some tough posturing on the issue of CBI closure report in the Bargari sacrilege case.

After the 550th Parkash Purb celebrations are over, voices are out and that too from CM’s home district Patiala. MLAs Madan Lal Jalalapur and Nirmal Singh Shutrana openly said bureaucracy was not listening to them and they also raised issues about CM’s accessibility. Another MLA, Rajinder Singh, sent a shocker by alleging that his phone calls were being tapped.

According to sources in the state Congress, apprehensions prevail among ministers and MLAs that with little to show on the Bargari sacrilege incident, any next development in the case may further push it to the centre stage. “We have already lost the sting in our attacks on Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on the issue as the probe has not progressed despite all the noise in the assembly session in August 2018. Now the issue can boomerang if it somehow comes to the fore again,” one Congress MLA said.

"Jagmel Singh’s murder, social inequalities echo in Punjab assembly","This story is from November 27, 2019

A special session of Punjab assembly underway on Constitution Day

CHANDIGARH: The need to improve the life of Dalits in Punjab and bring about social equality in society was highlighted as the state assembly passed a resolution to “preserve the basic structure of the Constitution” at a special session organised to mark Constitution Day on Tuesday.

Almost all leaders, cutting across party lines, hailed B R Ambedkar, helmed as the architect of India’s Constitution, and said his picture should be hung at educational institutions and in the assembly hall. Kicking off the debate, AAP MLA Sarvjit Kaur Manuke, said it had been seven decades since the Constitution came into force, but a section of society was still blaming reservation for SCs for holding them back. “But the irony is how many of those at top positions in the country are SCs? At the same, it is never acknowledged that few from the community are named in big frauds or have black money.”

“People like Jagmel Singh are forced to drink their own urine because there is lack of awareness about the Constitution. The need of the hour is to introduce the Constitution in school education up to Class X. Students should know the purpose of reservation and Ambedkar’s contribution. Pictures of him should be hung at government institutions as part of the effort. Otherwise, there could be a civil war-like situation and Dalits will continue to face atrocities,” she said.

SAD’s Pawan Kumar Tinu said incidents like the torture and murder of Jagmel in Sangrur proved that there was still inequality in society. Every few months there are such incidents and it is a grim reminder of what the downtrodden faced when caste system was in force. Ambedkar too had to go through a lot, he said. “Effort should be made to ensure a rich man’s child studies in the same government school as that of a poor man. Reservation has been provided on social and not economic status,” he said.

He asked the finance minister to spare some funds for the underprivileged and also fast-track Jagmel’s case.

Leader of opposition (LoP) Harpal Singh Cheema said Jagmel was not given timely medical treatment and those responsible for this should be taken to task. He alleged “saffronisation” of Constitutional institutions and said there was no need to implement the 85th amendment.

Speaking on Ambedkar, Congress MLA Raj Kumar Verka said contrary to his ideology, the present political disposition was trying to promote the private sector. “Punjab has the highest Dalit population in the country, but allocation for their welfare had never been more than 9%. SC students are not getting scholarships,” he said.

“There are countries like England with an unwritten Constitution, but citizens there understand the spirit of conventions. But today, the sentiments of people like Ambedkar have been forgotten,” added Parminder Singh Dhindsa of SAD.

Harinder Pal Singh Chandumajra said it was sad that Ambedkar got the Bharat Ratna 40 years later in 1990 and his political career was turbulent. “We need to introspect if we have been able to remove inequality and deliver quick justice,” he said.

Cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa said basic rights had been suspended in Jammu and Kashmir, and it was just like the Emergency. “Telephone services and internet have been suspended. Politicians cannot go there. But why are you quiet on that?” he said. He said in Jagmel case, the chargesheet had been filed in a week’s time. “Election Commission, IB and CBI are losing their identity and we need to save the Constitution. Gujarat riots were as wrong as the ones in Delhi,” he said.

Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar assures unhappy MLAs,"This story is from November 27, 2019

Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar met the four MLAs during a social function

PATIALA: Four Congress MLAs from Patiala district who raised several issues during a November 16 public meeting chaired by cabinet minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, met Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar on Monday evening.

The meeting took place at wedding ceremony here. Jakhar, who recently said he would hold a meeting with all party MLAs before taking up the issue of a “non-responsive bureaucracy” with chief minister Amarinder Singh, assured legislators Hardial Kamboj, Madan Lal Jalalpur, Rajinder Singh and Nirmal Singh Shautrana that the issues were in knowledge of those concerned, said a source in the party. The source added that he told them no stone would be left unturned in ensuring the issues raised by MLAs of the incumbent party were dealt with by district officials. He said feedback had been sought from all MLAs and the matter would be discussed with the CM.

The four MLAs had alleged that they were being sidelined. Rajinder, MLA from Samana, had claimed that his phone calls were being recorded by the in-charge of the crime investigating agency (CIA) wing of the police in Samana. Hardial, Rajpura MLA, said Patiala sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) had demanded a bribe of Rs 7 lakh from the sarpanch of Sular village and the in-charge of Rajpura CIA was patronising drug dealers.

Jalalpur, MLA from Ghanaur, had pointed out that police had failed to act against those who attacked Congress supporters inside the emergency ward of Rajpura civil hospital. Nirmal Singh, Shutrana MLA, had said local officials were unresponsive to issues raised by him and in implementing welfare schemes approved by the CM.

The state government has so far transferred the Patiala SDM to the personnel department in Chandigarh, while the in-charge of Samana CIA has been transferred to Nabha. The police department has dismissed in-charge of Rajpura along with two sub-inspectors for being hand in glove with drug dealers. The in-charge of Rajpura police, who had failed to arrest those who had attacked Congress supporters inside the civil hospital emergency ward, has been placed under suspension.

On Monday, Nirmal had said if he continued to be sidelined in his own constituency, he would protest outside the residence of the CM as all development projects in his constituency had been stalled. To placate the four legislators, who had raised serious concerns over the working of the government, Patiala MP Preneet Kaur had even taken them along to attend a ceremony at Nurmahal in a helicopter.

Goa: Vijai Sardesai loses another domain as government dissolves Ravindra Bhavan council,"This story is from November 27, 2019

MARGAO: The government on Tuesday appointed the director of art and culture as the administrator for Ravindra Bhavan, Margao, after dissolving its general council and executive body. Prashant Naik, Goa Forward Party (GFP) spokesperson, was the chairman of the Ravindra Bhavan since June 30, 2017, after the regional outfit joined the Manohar Parrikar-led government.

An order to that effect was issued by the director of art and culture Gurudas Pilarnkar under the provisions contained in the constitution of the Ravindra Bhavan, Margao.

The latest move has effectively stripped Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai of the control he wielded over Ravindra Bhavan since the last over two years. This is the second government body over which Sardesai’s dominion has come to an end. Earlier this year, soon after his ouster from the Pramod Sawant government in July, Renuka da Silva of GFP had resigned as the chairman of the South Goa Planning and Development Authority (SGPDA).

Naik, however, had declined to step down from his post claiming that the constitution of Ravindra Bhavan provides for the committee to hold office for a tenure of three years. Naik had said that his tenure ends in December. “I feel that considering the work we have done and the new programmes we have introduced in the last two years, we will continue until December 31,” Naik had said following GFP’s ouster from the government in July.

Naik had succeeded former Fatorda MLA Damodar Naik as the chairperson of Ravindra Bhavan, Margao.

After assuming charge, Naik had vowed to make Ravindra Bhavan “a happening place”. Resolving infrastructure-related problems, setting up a training academy in the field of theatre and film were some of Naiks plans after taking over the reins. As the executive council’s term stands effectively terminated, most of the plans lie unaccomplished.

Naik, however, declined to offer immediate comment over the dissolution of the executive council promising to address reporters on Wednesday.

‘Congress MLA hindering developmental works’,"This story is from November 27, 2019

BJP-Akali councillors with MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg

MOHALI: The rift between Akali-BJP councillors and Congress cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu is again going to flare up with the Mohali municipal corporation elections to be held in March 2020.

The trend of levelling allegations and counter allegations has already started catching pace on the two arch-rivals. The Akali-BJP councillors have allegedly levelled allegations against the local Congress MLA-cum-cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu for allegedly holding tenders for the developmental works.

Akali councillors met Kamal Kumar Garg, commissioner, municipal corporation, and submitted a memorandum to expedite the tendering process of developmental works, on Tuesday.

They said: “We have been suffering at the hands of the Congress minister-cum-local MLA as he is not letting the tenders cleared deliberately. It is a political vendetta. We are answerable to area residents who have been waiting for developmental works to be completed. He is sitting on the tenders which were opened two months ago. The tenders opened on October 10 are still pending.”

Garg said: “A delegation of local councillors came to me and requested to clear various developmental works. I have recently joined the office and will look into the matter and do what is best.” On the other hand, cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said the councillors had no other work, but to crib on any issue.

“They all are worthless and do such things deliberately for political mileage,” said Sidhu.

Earlier, Akali-BJP councillors and Congress minister were at loggerheads over the issue of inaugurating libraries and gymnasiums in the city.

Goa Forward approached tribunal as government failed: Vijai Sardesai,"This story is from November 27, 2019

Vijai Sardesai

PANAJI: Continuing his back-and-forth with chief minister Pramod Sawant over the Mhadei issue, GFP president Vijai Sardesai said Sawant did not support the unity of Goans to fight Karnataka over the diversion of the disputed river.

Slamming the chief minister’s criticism of GFP for going to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), Sardesai questioned why no counsel for the state of Goa was present at the NGT hearing to support the evidence produced by GFP against Karnataka.

“It is GFP that brought to the notice of the tribunal, with documentary evidence, that Karnataka wanted to construct a hydroelectric project and not a drinking water project. If Sawant was so concerned, why didn’t he ask the state counsel to represent Goa at the NGT hearing?” he asked. He said GFP approached the NGT because the state of Goa failed to do so. “We all know why Sawant didn’t go to NGT. It is because he is afraid to face Prakash Javadekar. He is the CM at the pleasure of Javadekar and others in the central government,” he said.

“Instead of criticising those who are doing whatever they can to protect Goa’s interests, he should answer why he didn’t go to NGT, or support us in the NGT,” he said, accusing Sawant of trying to politicise the issue.

Referring to Sawant’s statement that NGT rejected GFP’s petition, Sardesai asked, “Does he know the difference between disposal or rejection of a case?”

He said after the NGT order, GFP has pursued the case with a detailed representation to the ministry of environment, forest and climate change(MoEFCC). “Let the CM also tell the people if he led the all-party delegation to the Centre, asking for a committee on the Mhadei,” he asked, pointing out that the actual demand was the withdrawal of the October 17 letter from the MoEFCC giving clearance to Karnataka for the project.

Sardesai remarked that allowing Sawant to continue as chief minister was dangerous for Goa.

No politics on WhatsApp groups,"THE CODE OF CONDUCT IS IN FORCE & BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING



Election Commission

WhatsApp groups

.

In a first, the Media Certification and Monitoring Committee (MCMC) of Nanded district has issued notices to the administrators of 12 private WhatsApp groups for violating the model code of conduct by campaigning for candidate – even they though they weren’t the ones who posted the messages in question. The implications of this are huge. If you’re in a private WhatsApp group with some friends and – while the model code of conduct is in force – implore them to vote or not vote for a particular candidate, the administrator of the group could be in trouble if one of the members screenshots your message and sends it to the EC’s cVigil app. The same applies to Facebook and Twitter as well. Almost two years since the Cambridge Analytica scandal rocked the US presidential election, social media has become a battleground – and a hotbed for model code violations – in Indian elections too.Rajendra Chavan, member of Nanded MCMC, said, “One has to take prior permission from the EC before canvassing in any medium, whether it is print or electronic. If anyone indulges in campaigning without prior permission it amounts to a violation of the model code of conduct.” He added, “It doesn’t matter whether the message is for or against any candidate or party; if it has the potential to influence voters and has been send without prior permission from the EC, it amounts to a violation of the code of conduct.” Since the model code came into force in Maharashtra, the EC has received more than 1,200 complaints on the cVigil app.The notices sent by the Nanded MCMC simply ask the administrators of the 12 group to stop all election campaigning in their groups and visit the office of MCMC to explain their stand within seven days. A senior EC official said the violators would not be prosecuted but would be given a stern warning. But if the violations continue, stricter action could be taken. However, if it is found that a particular candidate was aware about such campaigning on social media on his behalf, he or she could be disqualified from contesting elections for four years, he added.In Mumbai city district, collector Shivaji Jondhale said that they are monitoring Facebook pages for such violations. Raju Patodkar, spokesperson for the Mumbai City Collectorate, said that Varsha Gaikwad, a Congress candidate from Dharavi, Sandeep Deshpande, an MNS candidate from Mahim, Sada Sarvankar, a Sena candidate from Mahim, and Yamini Jadhav, a Sena candidate from Byculla, had set up sponsored Facebook pages without permission and were issued notices.In Nanded, collector A Dongre said that similar notices have been sent to four administrators of WhatsApp groups for using social media without permission . Additional chief electoral officer Dilip Shinde said, “Permission is required from the competent certifying committee for political advertisements. Those who don’t take permission will get notices.”","THE CODE OF CONDUCT IS IN FORCE & BIG BROTHER IS WATCHINGElection CommissionWhatsApp groups.

Political process must for resolving water woes: Experts,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Aurangabad: Water management experts have underlined the need of a “political process” to resolve the water issues being faced by Marathwada.

“Water experts, lawyers, retired government officials and media have been doing their best to highlight the water problems of Marathwada, but their efforts have obvious limitations. Resolution of water problems is a political issue,” water management expert Pradeep Purandare said.

Activist Abhijit Dhanorkar said it was the collective responsibility of different stakeholders to join hands for waging a battle for the just share of the region in equitable water distribution. The stakeholders have also stressed that political parties, peoples’ organisations and political activists should study and understand the socio-economic-politico-legal complexities involved before arriving at informed decisions for framing water policies, strategies and programmes.

Coinciding with the fresh political agitation with a lead from BJP functionary Pankaja Munde, experts have released an indicative list of demands that could offer the desired relief for Marathwada.

“Top most priority needs to be given to soil conservation and river rejuvenation. There is a dire need for measurement of water and carrying out water audit. Such a measure can ensure development of resilience towards climate change,” Purandare said.

He added that the authorities concerned must prepare rules of equitable distribution of water at river-basin level and create an institutional as well as legal arrangement to implement those in letter and spirit.

“The rules should address only equitable distribution of available water. It should be left to the individual projects to decide purpose-wise distribution of water once they get their share of water,” Purandare said.

Strengthening of Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority and effective implementation of the Integrated State Water Plan are some of the key remedies the experts have pressed.

Among other demands, experts have laid emphasis on completing the operative part of Irrigation Acts by framing rules, issuing notifications and committing agreements.

“It is advisable to convert Irrigation Development Corporations into River Basin Authorities and promote water users’ associations by dissolving the Canal Advisory Committees. We have to bring lift irrigation under the purview of Irrigation Acts. It is completely un-regulated now,” Purandare said.

Delhi move to affect politics outside Pb?,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Jalandhar: Shiromani Akali Dal’s decision not to contest Delhi assembly elections, and its top brass remaining indecisive in taking a clear line and letting its Delhi unit decide on the issue, could have a far-reaching effect — end of the predominance of Punjab-based Akali leaders in deciding the political direction of Sikhs in other states and letting them take their own political decisions.

SAD’s Delhi unit has not yet decided what position it would take for the February 8 assembly polls. For decades, Akali Dal would have a say in the political affairs of Sikhs in states neighbouring Punjab, especially in Haryana and Delhi. At the same time, it would speak up on issues concerning Sikhs in distant states as well.

However, recent political developments, first in Haryana and now in Delhi, could be a turning point for the Punjab-based SAD’s politics in other states. In the past, Sikh leaders in Delhi, through their factions of Akali Dal, had been taking their own political lines also. However, Akali leadership of Punjab would have a say in their affairs. In Haryana also, it would play a significant role in leveraging Sikh voters.

Earlier, SAD had an alliance with the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) as its party patron and former Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal enjoyed close friendship with the Chautala family. This time, SAD faced an embarrassing situation after BJP refused to have an alliance with it for Haryana polls, despite its repeated expressions of interest.

Till around 40 years ago, Jag Asra Guru Ott (JAGO) party leader Manjit Singh GK’s father, late Jathedar Santokh Singh, would take his own path in Delhi, while maintaining a love-hate relationship with Punjab-based top leaders of Akali Dal. Nearly two decades ago, it was Paramjit Singh Sarna who charted his own path and minimised the influence of Badal and his family in the Sikh affairs of Delhi by taking away control of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC).

However, Punjab-based Akali leadership still played a significant part in deciding political course of the Sikhs in Delhi. “Akali Dal should confine its politics to Punjab only as it has been calling itself a Punjabi party and should leave Sikhs of other states to decide their own political course. They know local factors and politics better. They are wise enough to take their own decisions,” said former Rajya Sabha MP Tarlochan Singh, who remains one of Delhi-based key articulators of Sikh issues.

Sikh author Gurbachan Singh said the development in Delhi reflected the diminishing influence of the Badal-led Akali Dal in the political affairs of Sikhs in neighbouring states. “In a few years, Sikhs of these states would play politics that is independent of Akali Dal in Punjab,” he said.

Ex-mayor Bikash is Left-Congress’ RS nominee for 5th seat from Bengal,"This story is from March 11, 2020

File photo of Bikash Bhattacharya

KOLKATA: Left and Congress are fielding senior Calcutta high court lawyer and former mayor Bikash Bhattacharya for the fifth Rajya Sabha seat from Bengal, CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury said in Delhi on Tuesday.

Bhattacharya is likely to file his nomination on Thursday. “I will be filing my nomination on March 12 or 13,” he said.

Bhattacharya’s nomination as a Left-Congress joint candidate marks a departure from the past when Congress candidates, namely Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Pradip Bhattacharya , made it to Upper House with the support of Trinamool Congress. Congress’s hand-holding with Left in fielding Bhattacharya for the RS seat is likely to firm up the understanding between the two parties in the run-up to the 2021 assembly polls.

Bhattacharya, primarily a CPM leader, has broken barriers over a host of issues from taking up the Saradha Ponzi scam in the Supreme Court to speaking in support of civil liberty and environment. The high court lawyer didn’t hesitate to move Congress leader Abdul Mannan’s petition against the Saradha scam and also joined issues with political leaders and members of civil society under the Save Democracy umbrella.

Bhattacharya had filed his nomination as a Left candidate for Rajya Sabha three years ago in 2017. But the Election Commission found gaps in his nomination paper and cancelled it. In 2019, he contested on the CPM symbol from the Jadavpur Lok Sabha seat, but lost to TMC’s Mimi Chakrabarty.

Going by MLA count, neither Congress nor Left has the strength to win the fifth Rajya Sabha seat from Bengal when the other four are likely to go with Trinamool. The Bengal assembly now has 293 elected members of the total 294, following the demise of a member. The quota for getting elected for each candidate is thus 49 in terms of first preferential votes. The first preferential votes of Congress and Left taken together is much more than the remaining first preferential votes of Trinamool after getting four of its candidates through.

"MP political crisis: Will keep fighting, says CM Kamal Nath after 98 MLAs attend meet","This story is from March 11, 2020

Madhya Pradesh CM Kamal Nath

BHOPAL: With the Kamal Nath government teetering on the edge, the mood was grim but combative at the Congress legislative party meeting at chief minister Kamal Nath’s residence.

Sources said Nath has said they will fight on, and dare BJP to a floor test. Former PR minister P C Sharma claimed the resignations are fake. “Don’t worry. Picture abhi baki hai,” he said. According to sources, former minister Sajjan Singh Verma is flying to Bengaluru on Tuesday night.

Sources said 94 party MLAs and four Independents attended the meeting along with Rajya Sabha MP Digvijaya Singh. Discussions went on for more than two and half hours.

After the meeting, deputy Speaker Heena Kavre said, “We have been asked to stay united and fight together. The situation may be adverse but no one should have any fear. A senior party leader has betrayed us.”

Asked about Jyotiraditya Scindia , she said, “Jyotiraditya Scindia will not be discussed in Congress meetings any more. There was no talk about Scindia. He has been expelled from primary leadership of the party.” Outside the chief minister’s residence, emotions ran high. Congress workers shouted slogans in favour of Nath and against Scindia. At the party HQ, some of them ripped out Scindia’s nameplate and crushed it underfoot.

MLA from Kala Peepal constituency and state Youth Congress president Kunal Choudhary said Scindia has “betrayed every Congress worker who fought for Congress during 15 years of BJP rule”.

Congress leaders kept up a fighting front. “We will prove our majority on the floor of the House. All these resignations, the MLAs were told, is to pressurise for Rajya Sabha nomination,” said state Congress media department chairperson Shobha Oza after the CLP meeting.

Telangana to furnish report on action taken to resolve objections over polls,"This story is from November 24, 2019

Representative image

HYDERABAD: Justice A Rajasheker Reddy of the Telangana high court has asked the state municipal authorities to furnish to the petitioners in nearly 100 petitions the action they had taken on the objections raised over the pre-poll work done in 100 municipalities in the state.

The judge was hearing scores of pleas from various municipalities that charged the authorities with rushing to municipal polls without properly completing works like wards division, determination of reservations after properly identifying the reserved categories’ voters, preparation of ward-wise voters lists etc.

“The hurried job that they had done was beset with serious discrepancies and going to polls with such incomplete information will not augur well for democracy and local self-governance,” said Jandhyala Ravi Shankar, the counsel for one of the petitioners.

Several other advocates too raised their objections and wanted the state and the election commission to move ahead only after their objections are adequately addressed and resolved.

The state on its part has been contending that they had sufficiently attended to the grievances raised in all the pleas before the court. The judge directed the state to convey the same to the petitioners. The petitioners would respond after seeing the action taken report in each of the municipalities. The state was also citing an order of the division bench that ruled that even pre-poll work was part of poll process and hence cannot be stalled. Otherwise, the constitutional obligation to conduct timely elections to the local bodies would be defeated, the state counsel said. The case would come up for hearing on Tuesday.

Bisahulal Singh

BHOPAL: Tribal leader Bisahulal Singh , one of the 19 MLAs of the Congress who have sent their resignations to Madhya Pradesh governor Lalji Tandon, on Tuesday said he was feeling neglected in the ruling party.

Speaking to reporters, the senior-most legislator in the party said he was not under any pressure to quit.

""I have resigned from the Congress party because despite being senior-most MLA, I was feeling neglected. I have not resigned from the party under any pressure,"" he told reporters flanked by senior BJP leaders Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Yashodhara Raje Scindia , aunt of Jyotiraditya Scindia.

Notably, Bisahulal Singh had remained 'untraceable' for at least five days among other legislators of the Congress. He returned to Bhopal on Sunday from Bengaluru and met chief minister Kamal Nath.

‘No politics please’: CM rebuts MHA’s lockdown laxity charge,"Kolkata: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to “crosscheck facts” before blaming the Bengal government after the ministry of home affairs sent a stern missive to the state alleging “gross violation of lockdown measures” and warned of penal action against officers failing to enforce the lockdown under the Disaster Management Act, 2005.The MHA, in its letter to the chief secretary and dir-ector general of police, pointed to lockdown violations in several parts of the city: Rajabazar, Narkeldanga, Topsia, Metiabruz, Garden Reach, Ekbalpore and Maniktala. “Significantly, areas such as Narkeldanga are reportedly witnessing more Covid-19-like cases,” the letter states. The ministry also expressed its dismay over the opening of non-essential shops and the manner in which people were thronging vegetable, fish and meat shops in markets in the specified locations.“We are fighting a disease,” the CM rebutted. “Our aim is not to keep people hungry,” she said while urging people to maintain social distancing measures while shopping for essentials.Banerjee, however, did not go into a point-by-point exchange. “We are cooperating with the Centre. But some people are into mudslinging. This is not the time to do politics. Let us come together and fight the virus unite-dly,” she said, indicating that such provocations were coming from the BJP’s IT cell.The state government has set up a Restriction and Relaxation Task Force, under the chief secretary, to examine proposals to resume operations.Under Banerjee’s “humane lockdown” regime, relaxation has been given to shops selling staples, sweet shops and flower markets. Flour mills, oil mills and bakeries have also been allowed to resume operations, while home delivery is also on. The government has also opened tea gardens on the Centre’s directive. Police, however, sprang into action in “Covid-19-sensitive” areas on Saturday evening, increasing arrests of people loitering about.The MHA’s letter also referred to reports of police “allowing” religious congregations. “It has been reported that police have been allowing religious congregations. Free ration has been distributed not through the institutional delivery system, but by political leaders. This may have resulted in spread of Covid-19 infection,” the letter states.The chief minister urged the Union home minister to hold a meeting with security agencies in strictly manning the international borders Bengal shares with three countries. “We need strict manning of the international borders, because Bengal shares unfenced borders with neighbouring countries at many stretches. I have reports that some people sneaked into our territory a couple of days ago. Bengal shares borders with three countries. If Bengal becomes unsafe, it will affect other bordering states. Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and the entire Northeast can become vulnerable,” she said.She also raised the issue of a numbers mismatch between the Centre and the state over Covid-19-positive cases and deaths. “This is not fair. I said earlier that we are not announcing these numbers on our own. The government is announcing them after an audit performed by the medical experts’ committee, including the reason of death. There have been instances when patients having chronic heart and kidney ailments took admission in hospitals and were later tested Covid-19-positive. We sent the figures to the experts’ panel following their death to ascertain whether the deaths were due to Covid-19 or co-morbidities. I told the PM to crosscheck facts before heaping allegations. Fact is, most Covid-19 patients are responding to medicine,” the CM said.","Flour mills, oil mills and bakeries have also been allowed to resume operations, while home delivery is also on.

As the Maharashtra political drama shifted to the Supreme Court on Sunday ( Read: SC asks Centre to place letters of Guv, Fadnavis; rival alliances claim majority ), the BJP claimed thatandhad the support of 170 MLAs. The majority mark in a House of 288 is 145, and the BJP is the single-largest party with 105 MLAs. A senior BJP leader said that 14 independents were already supporting the party and of the seven independent MLAs supporting the Sena, six have crossed over to the BJP.The leader claimed that Ajit has the support of 22 MLAs, and a total of around 25 MLAs from the Shiv Sena, Congress and the NCP were like to vote for them when the Speaker’s election is held. A Supreme Court bench of Justices NV Ramana, Ashok Bhushan and Sanjiv Khanna yesterday rejected the Sena-NCP-Congress plea to direct the Fadnavis government to undertake the floor test within 24 hours, saying this issue would be dealt with only after reading the letters of the Governor inviting Fadnavis as well as the communication of the BJP leader staking his claim. The court asked the Centre to submit the two letters today. BJP’ssaid thathas given time till November 30 to the new government to prove its majority.The BJP sources said a majority of the independent MLAs have been sent out of Maharashtra. “Besides the independent MLAs, 15 NCP MLAs were present for Ajit Pawar’s swearing-in ceremony. This is a clear indication that they are all with him,” the BJP leader said.Sources said that the BJP has launched Operation Shivtej and Operation Speaker to win the trust vote, on the lines of its Operation Lotus that brought down the HD Kumaraswamy government in Karnataka.Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil, former leader of the opposition who joined the BJP just before the Assembly election, has been given responsibility of targeting Congress MLAs from western Maharashtra and Marathwada. The Rajya Sabha member and former chief minister, Narayan Rane, has been asked to ensure cross-voting from Sena MLAs. Sanjay Kute, a former minister in Fadnavis’s previous government who is known to have friendships and blood relations across party lines, has been asked to work on Congress-NCP MLAs from Vidarbha. Besides, Prashant Thakur, the MLA from Panvel, is in contact with the Congress, NCP and Sena MLAs from Mumbai, Thane and Raigad districts.The first cabinet meeting of the Fadnavis government is expected to take place in a day or two, during which a session of the newly elected Assembly will be called. Once the session begins, the pro-term Speaker will assume office and start administering the ‘oath of office and secrecy’ to MLAs. The process will likely take a day-and-a-half, after which election to the Speaker’s post will be called. The BJP and Ajit Pawar’s faction of the NCP, and the Congress-NCP-Sena combine will nominate candidates for the post. The MLAs will vote in a secret ballot, and there will be no way to tell which ones will follow the party whip.-----------------------------------------------------------ByThe Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Sunday claimed that all the MLAs that Ajit Pawar was banking on has pledged support to party boss. On Sunday when Uddhav Thackeray and Pawar met with NCP MLAs (see Page 4), the party spokesperson, Clyde Crasto, dubbed Pawar as “renaissance man”. “Hey #BJP, Game on. Our Renaissance Man v/s your modern day so-called ‘#Chanakya’. Bring it on,” Crasto tweeted.The NCP said that three of its five MLAs, who went ‘missing’ on Saturday after attending the swearing-in of Fadnavis and Ajit, have been contacted. Till Sunday morning, five NCP MLAs -- Daulat Daroda (Shahapur), Nitin Pawar (Kalwan), Narhari Zhirwal (Dindori), Babasaheb Patil (Ahmedpur), and Anil Patil (Amalner) --were reported missing.The party has been able to contact Anil Patil, Babasaheb Patil and Daroda, NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said. Malik took to Twitter and tagged Anil Patil’s tweet in which the latter said he pledged loyalty to Sharad Pawar.Ajit also took to social media yesterday to thank everyone, includingand, who congratulated him on taking oath as deputy chief minister. He then attempted another googly at Pawar, tweeting: “I am in the NCP and shall always be in the NCP and Pawar Saheb is our leader. Ourshall provide a stable government in Maharashtra for the next five years which will work sincerely for the welfare of the state and its people.”The tweet sparked fresh speculation as to how many NCP MLAs were supporting him. Pawar immediately responded with a tweet, posting: “There is no question of forming an alliance with BJP. NCP has unanimously decided to ally with Shiv Sena and Congress to form the government. Shri Ajit Pawar’s statement is false and misleading to create confusion and false perception among the people.”Earlier in the day, senior NCP leaders Dilip Walse Patil and Jayant Patil met Ajit at his south Mumbai residence. Sources said that they asked him to resign and come back to the party fold.","Devendra FadnavisAjit PawarAshish ShelarGovernor Bhagat Singh KoshyariRohit Pawar, Supriya Sule's emotional appeal as Ajit Pawar joins BJP government Interestingly, Supriya Sule too has posted a WhatsApp status, hinting that the family is keen to see Ajit Pawar change his mind and come back.

"Political leaders booked for cheating, extortion in separate cases","This story is from January 25, 2020

Nagpur: Local leaders of two political parties have been booked recently for fraud and extortion. A senior woman leader, representing a political party in power, was arrested by Bajaj Nagar police on January 21 for siphoning off almost Rs11 lakh in the name of a car loan from a private financial institute. Another group of political party workers was booked for extortion by Pardi police on Friday, while they were trying to extort money from a betel-nut trader by threatening to ‘expose’ him.

In the first case, women unit wing leader of Prabhag 10 Savita Kadwe was arrested by Bajaj Nagar police after her involvement in a racket to dupe a financial institute in the name of car loan came to fore. Kadwe, immediately after the arrest, complained of illness and got herself admitted at hospital where she was taken for medical examination as part of arrest procedures. Cops have reserved their right to take her custody remand after discharge.

After Kadwe’s arrest, Bajaj Nagar police have also registered an offence against Swati Pawar and Swapnil Ramteke for posing as government officials to dupe the financial institute to the tune of Rs9.61 lakh.

In Friday’s incident, Zonal DCP Neelotpal cracked down on the group of political workers led by Nagesh Dedmuthe, who tried to allegedly extort Rs10,000 per month from betel traders Narendra Dahikar and Sanjay Jaiswal at Pardi. Apart from Dedmuthe, his two accomplices, Rakesh Jadhav and Vicky Meshram, too have been named in the FIR. Police are now trying to ascertain the roles of others involved with Dedmuthe.

Later in the evening, Dedmuthe too issued a press release, claiming that he was wrongly framed. Dedmuthe also said that he had alerted the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and also police control room about poor quality of betel nut being stored at the godown before leaving for the place.

Dahikar, who lodged a police complaint against Dedmuthe, said the political group had barged into their godown and asked for ‘payment’ to suppress the issue of stocking bad quality betel nut, but his workers informed him. “There is nothing for which we are supposed to pay any political group that is summoning police to raid us,” he said.

It’s learnt that the cops reached the place after Dedmuthe called up the control room. As Pardi police were inquiring into the issue, DCP Neelotpal too visited the place on hearing about the so-called raid. He is learnt to have asked Pardi police to take necessary action since the political group could not explain their present there.

Sources said Dedmuthe and his gang had conducted a similar raid last week at Kalamna, where also cops were present. A press note was also issued by Dedmuthe’s outfit saying he had got the raid conducted.

Sources in the trade said some political groups are active in the city in extorting money from betel nut traders, threatening to expose them and file complaints with police and other agencies.

"Madhya Pradesh political crisis: Who &amp; when, key questions in cabinet expansion","This story is from March 8, 2020

Madhya Pradesh CM Kamal Nath

BHOPAL: The ongoing political turmoil in MP may soon pave the way for first expansion of Kamal Nath cabinet. The government wants to do it after the budget session while independents and disgruntled Congress leaders want it earlier.

Budget session of MP assembly begin from March 16. It will have 17 sittings and conclude on April 13. Budget session could be a litmus test for government. Voting for three Rajya Sabha seats would also take place on March 26. The government wants to pass it smoothly with assurance of ministerial berths to MLAs, minimizing possibility of horse-trading by BJP.

Apart from cabinet expansion, the Nath government would also make political appointments in boards and corporations. There are 28 ministers in MP cabinet.

The strength in 230 member assembly cannot exceed beyond 34. At least five sitting MLAs would be made to resign to accommodate new faces. Congress ministers offered to step down in the cabinet meet a day earlier to save the government.

Ministers that would be dropped would be from Kamal Nath and Digvijay Singh camps while one from Jyotiraditya Scindia camp may not be asked to step down, as they had been vocal against the alleged neglect of Scindia in Madhya Pradesh. The ministers have been asked to remain in the state capital as much possible for the next few days. Congress has 114 MLAs, two short of majority in the House of 230. Four independent MLAs, two BSP and one SP MLA are supporting the Kamal Nath government .

Four independent MLAs are Kedar Dawar (Bhagwanpura), Pradeep Jaiswal (Waraseoni), Rana Vikram Singh (Susner) and Surendra Singh 'Shera Bhaiya' (Burhanpur). Pradeep Jaiswal is already with the Congress as mineral resources minister.

Surendra Singh, who allegedly went with BJP earlier this week, but denied on returning to Bhopal on Saturday has several times expressed displeasure for not getting ministerial berth.

Two BSP MLAs supporting the government are Sanjeev Singh (Bhind), Rambai Singh (Pathariya) while Rajesh Kumar Shukla (Bijawar) is the lone SP legislator supporting the government. Rambai- also allegedly among the ones in talks with BJP and went to New Delhi earlier this week, said on Thursday she is confident that Kamal Nath would consider her whenever cabinet expansion takes place in the state.

Sources said government has worked out a formula of cabinet expansion. One among two from BSP MLAs could be given ministerial berth and will be adjusted in board or corporation. Similarly, two independents could be made state ministers and one would be accommodated in board and corporation. The list of ministers in waiting is long among Congress MLAs and who would become ministers and who would be dropped among sitting ministers will remain suspense till expansion takes place.

Speculation of cabinet expansion has been doing the rounds ever since senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh recently said that the expansion should take place after the assembly's budget session. The same statement was later repeated by ministers and other senior Congress leaders.

Political rivals invoke Netaji to speak on CAA,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Kolkata: Bengal politicians paid glowing tributes on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s birth anniversary on Thursday, and tried to justify their stance on CAA , both for and against.

Kolkata mayor and Trinamool senior Firhad Hakim held that the central government couldn’t have promulgated the “divisive” citizenship law had Netaji been alive. “Netaji would never have allowed discrimination on religious lines. He had Prem Sehgal and Shah Nawaz Khan as his lieutenants,” Hakim said, remembering Netaji, who was once the city’s mayor.

Bengal BJP also celebrated Netaji’s birth anniversary across the state. “We wouldn’t have to face Partition if Netaji was alive. He would have opposed the British plan supported by Muslim League and communists. Congress accepted Partition. If there was no Partition, the question of CAA wouldn’t have been there because the act provides citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains who were forced to leave Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh due to religious persecution,” said BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu.

Left parties took out a rally to observe “Deshprem Divas”. CPM politburo member Mohammad Selim said students raising “azadi” slogans are being termed anti-nationals by BJP when Netaji had set up the Azan Hind Fauj (Indian National Army) to fight for Independence. “Take a look at Netaji’s lieutenants — Prem Sehgal, Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon and Shah Nawaz Khan. They came from different communities and religions, representing Netaji’s dream of a secular India. Today, the descendants of Nathuram Godse are trying to teach a lesson to Khudiram’s descendants,” he said.

Goa: Political parties submit laundry list for grants,"This story is from January 24, 2020

The panel met with over 20 representatives of various political parties

PANAJI: The 15th Finance Commission headed by its chairman N K Singh, met with over 20 representatives of various political parties and local bodies here on Thursday during the panel’s three-day visit to Goa.

Both Congress and Goa Forward Party (GFP) stressed that the parameters used to allocate funds for Goa were flawed and needed a revamp.

GFP requested the commission for Rs 6,700 crore, the most while Congress and BJP sought Rs 2,610 crore and Rs 1,300 crore respectively.

GFP recommendations for higher devolution of funds was based on the state’s ecological and linguistic vulnerability. Congress also said that Goa was vulnerable, but with respect to climate change and rise in sea water levels.

“GFP demands the commission may sanction a one-time grant of Rs 6,000 crore for rehabilitating people affected by closure of mining and to provide them alternative employment till resumption of mining,” said GFP president Vijai Sardesai . BJP in contrast sought Rs 300 crore to assist those affected by the closure of mining.

BJP’s recommendations focused on mining, tourism, solid waste management and agriculture. “An amount of Rs. 250 crore may be allocated to undertake activities which shall boost tourism,” said state BJP president Sadanand Tanavade.

Congress and GFP said the influx of migrants and falling birth rates in the state had brought about societal changes and threatened Goa’s culture. In order to counter this, both GFP and Congress sought additional grants to help preserve local culture and identity.

Congress sought Rs 150 crore to implement the Goenche Daiz scheme which will benefit 80,000 traditional artisans, Rs 100 crores for conservation of ancient forts and heritage sites, Rs 5 crore for revival of Perani Zagor and Rs 5 crore to get UNESCO heritage inscription for Goa's Tiatr art form.

'Release of VK Sasikala will bring about changes in Tamil Nadu politics',"This story is from March 7, 2020

Subramanian Swamy

COIMBATORE: BJP leader Subramanian Swamy has said that V K Sasikala, a confidante of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa, would bring about changes in Tamil Nadu politics after her release from the Parappana Agarahara prison in Bengaluru.

Talking to reporters here on Friday, Swamy said Sasikala cannot be excluded from Tamil Nadu politics easily. Sasikala who is undergoing prison term after her conviction in the disproportionate assets case is expected to be released in February 2021.

“There will be changes in Tamil Nadu politics after her release. It will be difficult to exclude her from politics in Tamil Nadu once she comes out,” Swamy said. “She has experience, talent and a whole community behind her,” he added.

Swamy, however, pointed out that she cannot contest in elections for six years after being released.

Stating that there was no hurry in appointing the party’s state president for Tamil Nadu, Swamy said BJP is capable of winning the assembly election and forming a government in the state on its own. But no attempts have been made yet in that direction, he said.

Swamy dismissed a query on actor Kamal Haasan’s prospects by asking, `Who is Kamal?’ even as he expressed his willingness to support Rajnikanth given the actor stand on Hinduism. “I will support him if he stands for Hinduism. If he speaks the same way he spoke at Tughlaq anniversary event, I will help him,” Swamy said.

On the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Swamy said there was nothing which is anti-Muslim in the legislation. “There is nothing wrong in protests in a democracy, but lies should not be peddled to stoke fear,” he said.

Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray ticks items on NCP-Congress checklist,"This story is from December 28, 2019

Uddhav Thackeray

MUMBAI: Barely a month in office and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is fast adapting himself to the NCP-Congress brand of politics with aplomb, political analysts said on Friday.

Thackeray’s speech earlier this week at the annual general body meeting of the Vasantdada Patil Sugar Institute (VPSI) in Pune marked his initiation into the co-operative movement, around which the Maratha kingpins of western Maharashtra wove their political narrative in the 1960s, they pointed out. NCP president and VPSI chief Sharad Pawar was in the chair.

Thackeray assured the sugar barons that the Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi regime would leave no stone unturned to firm up the ailing cooperative sector which faces stiff competition from sugar factories in Uttar Pradesh.

Thackeray promised the institute a plot in Marathwada to start its branch there. He later rubbed shoulders with sultans of sugar factories -- all key NCP-Congress politicians with whom he will have to break bread as head of the Aghadi regime. “Pawar has made me the CM; he will guide me in running the administration,” he said.

“In his first week in office Thackeray indulged in some kind of tokenism -- for instance, he extended the nomenclature of the Shivaji University in Kolhapur to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj University. He declared that BIT chawl in Dadar, which was the residence of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, would be preserved as a national monument. However, the CM is now coming into his own and seems set to address issues that define the NCP-Congress narrative,” said a key NCP politician.

He referred to the state cabinet’s recent loan waiver decision which will benefit over 39 lakh farmers in the state wracked by drought and unseasonal rain. The Mahatma Phule Shetkari Karz Mukti Yojana will provide a loan waiver up to Rs2 lakh taken till September 30 this year. The scheme may cost the state exchequer Rs29,800 crore, according to preliminary estimates.

“The rural populace is the bulwark of the NCP-Congress, while the Sena is by and large an urban organisation. It will have to learn to accord priority to agriculture, irrigation, and water and soil conservation,” said the NCP politician. The BJP, Sena’s former Hindutva partner, too is seen as an urban party, he added.

The NCP-Congress’ tilt in favour of agrarian issues can be understood by the fact that Congress, an Aghadi ally, is keen on bagging one of two key portfolios -- rural development or co-operation -- in the cabinet expansion, it is learnt. The NCP currently heads the two departments. Thackeray will add new ministers to his cabinet on December 30, by which time he, Pawar and state Congress leaders hope to resolve the portfolio issue. Also, the alacrity with which the Aghadi government acted on an FIR involving four Shiv Sainiks who tonsured a VHP activist for his remarks against the CM reflects Sena’s urgency. “The Sena is showing signs it is keen to learn and unlearn as well,” added a Congress neta. But much depends on how far grassroot Sainiks are willing to change stripes, he added.

However, the CM is now coming into his own and seems set to address issues that define the NCP-Congress narrative,” said a key NCP politician.
“The rural populace is the bulwark of the NCP-Congress, while the Sena is by and large an urban organisation.
Thackeray will add new ministers to his cabinet on December 30, by which time he, Pawar and state Congress leaders hope to resolve the portfolio issue."
Shiv Sena mayors target private banks amid row over Amruta Fadnavis,"This story is from December 28, 2019

Amruta Fadnavis

MUMBAI/THANE: Amidst a brewing controversy over a government proposal to move salary accounts from private to nationalised banks, the Thane mayor on Friday urged the city’s civic administration to carry out the shift at the earliest.

The development comes days after a statement by state finance minister Jayant Patil that the Shiv Sena-led government was “considering” shifting employee salary accounts from Axis Bank, where Amruta Fadnavis , wife of former CM Devendra Fadnavis holds a senior position. Patil’s statement was seen to perpetuate the impression that Fadnavis had favoured his wife’s employer during his tenure.

Mayor Naresh Mhaske said his own statement was merely aimed at directing the administration to comply with rules for investments. “Government-related accounts should be in nationalized banks,"" he said. Sena corporator and Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar echoed her party colleague’s refrain saying the BMC, India’s largest civic body by assets, needed to ensure its investments were safe. She said “there is need to think about the best available option” in the light of irregularities in financial institutions. However, she added, “if we decide to shift money from a private bank, it will be from all private banks.”

Amruta Fadnavis said it was obvious the ruling parties were targeting her husband. She said her criticism of the Aghadi regime through tweets had contributed to it. “The government should take criticism positively for betterment instead of adopting such a step,” she said, adding she worked in a back office of Axis Bank and had never been asked by her employer to give references.

Officials said the administration in Thane and Mumbai used accounts in various banks to carry out business, bulk of it through PSU banks. In Thane, salaries are disbursed from Bank of Maharashtra, a PSU bank. Most investments are also parked with PSU banks, said an official. “We have minimal accounts with private or cooperative banks. Just two accounts related to receipts of local body tax money and service taxes are with Axis Bank.”

Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray unveils miniature model of Pune Metro coaches,"This story is from December 28, 2019

Uddhav Thackeray

PUNE: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday unveiled the look of the coaches for the Pune Metro rail project.

Thackeray unveiled a miniature model of a coach at a programme in Mumbai on Friday, a statement issued by the Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited stated.

The statement added that the coaches have arrived in Pune from Nagpur. “Three coaches will form one train,” the statement added. “All will be interconnected and one will be reserved for women. These coaches will be fitted on the elevated route. The trials of the service will start soon,” it stated.

One rake will be able to carry 950-970 passengers. The train can travel at a maximum speed of 90 kmph. Each coach will be air-conditioned and have mobile phone and laptop charging facilities.

MahaMetro officials said the Indian subsidiary of an Italian company will build 12 coaches for the project. According to a contract signed with the firm, 25% of the coaches will be manufactured at its Italy plant, while the rest will be commissioned at the Maha Coach Manufacturing Plant in Nagpur.

The coaches will be made of stainless steel and aluminium — a first in India — and are lightweight. MahaMetro said that these coaches will be energy efficient. Each coach will have ambient sensors, which will lower or increase the brightness of the LED lights as required.

The trials are expected to begin on a 3km-long priority section of the Pimpri Chinchwad-Dapodi elevated segment.

"Dhaval Jani’s promotion cancelled, Gujarat high court asks how he was upgraded","This story is from November 16, 2019

Dhaval Jani

AHMEDABAD: The state government has cancelled its order of promotion to deputy collector Dhaval Jani, who was the returning officer for the Dholka assembly polls in 2017 and under whose supervision “glaring breaches” were noticed by the Gujarat high court in the counting of votes.

The senior advocate for education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, Nirupam Nanavati, on Friday produced in the high court and the government notification dated November 9 cancelling Jani’s promotion “ab initio” by the general administration department. Jani had been promoted from Class I (junior scale) to Class I (senior scale) by upgrading his post from deputy collector to additional collector in the metro rail project.

When the notification was placed before the high court, Justice Paresh Upadhyay said he wanted to know the process by which the government promoted Jani even after the Election Commission of India (ECI) recommending a major penalty against him, following the HC’s observations. The judge insisted on a clarification as to how the officials in charge of departmental promotions met and how they came to a conclusion to promote the officer. The HC has granted a week’s time to explain the process of Jani’s promotion, which came to be cancelled after the high court last month posed an inquiry about it.

Jani was the returning officer for the Dholka constituency during the assembly polls in 2017. His role came into question after he decided to cancel 429 postal ballots during the counting and Chudasama went on to win by 327 votes over the Congress candidate, Ashwin Rathod.

Interestingly, the HC has been posing these queries to Chudasama, who once held the revenue portfolio.

In April, Jani was cross-examined and admitted to irregularities during the counting process. The high court indicted Jani and the election observer, a Rajasthan-cadre IAS officer Vinita Bohra, for glaring breaches in the election process. After the HC recorded the alleged irregularities in its order and communicated them to the ECI, the latter recommended that the governments concerned impose major penalties on the officers, for breaching the election norms.

Meanwhile, the high court has begun hearing final arguments from Rathod’s advocates after the recording of evidence ended a couple of months ago.

Bihar government to invest adequately in children: Sushil Kumar Modi,"This story is from November 15, 2019

Sushil Kumar Modi

PATNA: Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, who also holds the finance portfolio, released the standard operating procedure (SOP) for child budgeting in the state on the occasion of Children’s Day on Thursday.

The SOP launch was organised by state finance department in collaboration with UNICEF-Bihar and the Asian Development Research Institute (ADRI). UNICEF-Bihar and ADRI had provided technical support in developing the SOP.

Modi said it was critical to “invest” adequately in children in Bihar as half of state’s population is under the age of 18 years. “The child budget document is not independent of the state budget. It is instead an analysis of state budget allocations that improve the well-being of children,” Modi said, highlighting three points related to child survival – reducing infant mortality rate (IMR), decreasing malnutrition and providing safe drinking water to children.

Modi said each child has the right to be protected from sexual abuse, violence and neglect for their holistic development.

Modi said between 2013-14 and 2017-18, the state government allocated Rs 80,827.85 crore towards child development and spent Rs 67,101.02 crore during the same period. The total allocation for children during this period has increased at an annual rate of 18.1%, while the expenditure has grown at a rate of 26.1%.

Principal secretary of finance department S Siddharth said along with Assam and Kerala, Bihar is one of the three Indian states that publish child budget document.

Asadur Rahman, chief, UNICEF-Bihar field office, said the state government’s step to strengthen its child budgeting processes is a testimony to its commitment to uphold child rights.

Artwork for the document was provided by a group of students of Kilkari-Bihar Bal Bhawan and the Bihar Youth for Child Rights forum.

Welcoming the guests, Prabhat P Ghosh, director, ADRI, said child development had traditionally been viewed as a “welfare activity” with the perception that its economic returns are rather limited. “With this SOP, the state government has taken a highly welcome step to break the vicious circle of poverty and low human development,” he added.

Pawar taught me to form government with fewer numbers: Uddhav Thackeray,"This story is from December 26, 2019

Uddhav Thackeray

PUNE: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, taking a dig at its former alliance partner BJP, drew parallels between his government and high sugar cane production in smaller land parcels.

“Pawar has proven how to cultivate more sugar cane in less space. He has performed a miracle in politics by forming a government with fewer MLAs,” he said.

Even if BJP had more numbers, Sena could defeat them with fewer MLAs, he added. He also referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech at VSI in 2016 where he had called Pawar his guide, saying that the Maratha leader had hand-held and taught him how to walk in politics during his early days as chief minister of Gujarat. “I won’t say it was mistake,” Thackeray said.

He said those who had shifted loyalties before the state election and joined the BJP may now join Maha Vikas Aaghadi. BJP functionary Harshvardhan Patil of Indapur and Pawar’s former state cabinet colleague Vijaysinh Mohite Patil of Akluj were on the stage with Pawar and Thackeray. Both are board members of the institute.

Patil had left the Congress blaming NCP for backstabbing him and fought the state election on a BJP ticket.

Mohite Patil’s son Ranjitsinh Mohite-Patil joined BJP and campaigned for the BJP candidate in Madha during the Lok Sabha election.

“Some leaders sitting on the dais here have become our co-workers in this new government. Those, who are not, may work with us as our colleagues in future,” Thackeray said.

Power shift: Ministers clear out of offices,"This story is from November 14, 2019

The main activity involved the vacating of offices occupied by the previous chief minister and his council of ... Read More

MUMBAI: On a Wednesday, the secretariat—or Mantralaya as it’s better known—is a hive of activity. It’s the day after the weekly cabinet meeting, and ministers are usually found walking in and out of offices, seeing off visitors from across the state, calling for files or a briefing.

This week though, the picture was different. As an indefinite period of President’s rule began in the state, there were barely any visitors in the building. Bureaucrats, who are otherwise trying to keep up with busy schedules, were in their seats, placidly carrying on routine work without a sense of urgency.

The most conspicuous activity involved the vacating of offices occupied by the previous chief minister and his council of ministers. A circular from the general administration department (GAD) on Wednesday directed that the CM's and ministers’ offices be cleared, cleaned and the keys deposited with the GAD by Wednesday evening. There are, in all, 43 ministers in the state including the CM.

When TOI visited some offices in Wednesday, the staff was packing away files and removing wall hangings and office gear. ""We have a lot of furniture the minister had got for the stafflike a refrigerator, a kettle, an air purifier, some chairs and paintings. All these things will be taken away,” said his personal staff.

The official circular said office staff must complete all paperwork in case of pending salaries, conveyance, telephone bills and deposit it with respective departments. ""We have asked them to clean the offices and take their personal belongings with them. Once we take charge of the office it will not be opened again until the next occupant comes along. Also, all furniture and electronics that the government provides have to be kept in working condition,"" said a GAD official.

A minister’s office usually has a staff strength of 15, of which all but three—peon, driver and personal assistant—are government employees. Government staff in ministers’ offices on deputation will now be sent back to parent departments, but those hired by ministers, though paid as per official norms, can only stay on as part of his/her personal staff.

An officer on special duty in a senior minister’s office, who will now be sent back to his parent cadre, said, ""I've worked in a minister’s office earlier, but the last five years were memorable…we achieved a lot. Our relations went beyond the office, we knew each other’s families and often visited each other’s homes. We are hoping that the deadlock is resolved soon and we can start working again.”

Bureaucrats turn to governor’s office for board decisions,"This story is from November 14, 2019

PUNE: Metros, development plans, ring roads, affordable housing schemes, land acquisitions for Metros and several other projects will take a back seat as the President’s rule in the state will hold up decisions.

The central government now has direct control of the state and the governor becomes its constitutional head. There is no council of ministers and the Vidhan Sabha is either dissolved or prorogued. The governor will get an advisor to assist him in the day-to-day activities of the government.

Several infrastructural projects and land acquisitions await decisions and bureaucrats would have to take permission from the governor’s office to speed them up.

Bureaucrats heading metropolitan region authorities, housing boards and several other state bodies fear a delay in decisions will affect infrastructural projects in the state. The chief minister is the chairman of these boards.

“We are waiting for instructions from the governor's office after the state was placed under the President's rule on Tuesday,” a senior bureaucrat, who had lined up a board meeting to clear several decisions after the elections, told TOI on Monday. Day-to-day operations will not be affected.

No projects will be sanctioned, and no major policy decisions, including subsidies, will be taken till the next government is formed, key officials said.

“This was totally unexpected. We are not sure who will clear our proposals now,’’ another bureaucrat said. Many hope the government will be formed soon by political parties in the six-month time frame.

After the imposition of President’s rule, the de facto administrative control of the government passes into the hands of chief secretary Ajoy Mehta.

If no party forms a government, the election commission will have to conduct a re-election in six months. ECI officials said they would begin preparations after the assembly is dissolved.

“Power rests with the central government now. The daily administration won’t face any issues but policy decisions cannot be taken,’’constitutional expert Ulhas Bapat said. The expenditure fund can be sanctioned by President or Parliament to the governor.

Sportsman spirit should always prevail in politics: Scindia,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Indore: There should be no politics on playground, but sportsman spirit should always prevail in politics, said senior Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, who inaugurated the newly renovated Scindia Pavilion of the historical cricket ground on Daly College premises on Sunday.

This 110-year-old pavilion has been revamped to international standards in a year.

“I am extremely proud to inaugurate this pavilion. It was built by my great grandfather Madho Rao Scindia-I in 1910. Although the pavilion has been renovated, the spirit is still the same. This pavilion has now been renovated and the ground quality is also extremely good now as a lot of investments have been done. I’m sure excellent players will come from this ground,” said Scindia, who is one of the patrons of Daly College.

A friendly cricket match was played between Daly College Board President XI and Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association XI. The 13-over match was won by Daly College Board President's XI. Senior Ranji players also participated in the match.

The match commenced with renowned cricket player and former headmaster of Daly College Vaman Jagtap ringing the huge brass bell at Scindia pavilion. Batting first, the Daily XI scored 126 runs for loss of three wickets in 13 overs. Sanjay Thakar scored 23 runs, Jai Singh Jhabua and Gajendra Singh contributed 20 runs each.

Murtaza and Pankaj Pandey took one wicket each for Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association XI. In response, MPCA XI managed to score 117 runs for loss of six wickets in 13 overs. Scindia played for MPCA team and managed to score four runs.

Scindia thereafter went to seek blessings of Acharya Vidyasagar, who has been in city since January 5.

"India learnt to live without politics, religion during lockdown: Scientist","BENGALURU: ""The country has learnt to live without politics and religion,"" says eminent scientist G Madhavan Nair on the lockdown imposed across the nation to curb the spread of COVID-19.

""This is a great achievement,"" observed the former Chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation.

He said this trend should be continued after every election, with all the political activities pushed into the background and everybody concentrating on nation-building.

On COVID-19, Nair told 'PTI': ""Actually, many of these viruses are dormant on the earth, and when favourable conditions come, they flare up. If you look at the last three centuries or beyond, once in 100 years, something or the other breaks out. So, its a natural phenomenon.""

He said Indians have demonstrated their unity, standing up together without any caste, creed and political colour in the battle to combat the spread of the Coronavirus, adding, the same approach should be adopted in nation building.

Nair said implementation of various measures aimed at halting the spread was being spearheaded largely the bureaucracy, who have risen up to the occasion extremely well and same tempo has to be maintained.

In the matter of bringing COVID-19 relief package to people, India has been able to cut out the middle-men, he said.

""Previously all the funds used to be leaked out to middlemen and that used to really deny benefits which are supposed to reach the people. So that process (cutting out middlemen), if it's continued, it's definitely good for the country,"" Nair said.

Noting that India has a huge domestic market, he pitched for giving a thrust to the indigenisation progragramme, which perhaps had taken a back-seat for quite some time because of readily available things outside.

""Now is the time for Indian industries and research laboratories to wake up and give a big push to indigenisation drive,"" Nair underlined.

Politics is being played over human chain: Congress,"This story is from January 19, 2020

PATNA: Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leader in the state assembly, Sadanand Singh, said on Saturday that he would not participate in the much-hyped human chain proposed by chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar on Sunday. He alleged that “certain kind of politics is being played” in the name of the awareness drive on environment and climate change.

“It is true that I had extended my support to the state government’s Jal-Jivan-Hariyali Abhiyan because it is meant for the welfare of all living creatures. I will, however, not join the human chain because certain kind of politics is being played over it now,” Singh told TOI on Saturday and rejected reports suggesting that he would participate in the human chain.

State Congress chief Madan Mohan Jha had earlier opposed the human chain and alleged that the government funds were being misused.

“A meeting on the bad impact of climate change was convened in the central hall of the assembly, in which members of all political parties had participated few months ago. Moreover, the CM had visited all the districts as part of his Jal-Jivan-Hariyali Yatra recently and held meetings and rallies. All that was enough to create awareness about the campaign,” Singh said.

He added, “Instead of spending money on the human chain, the government should have focused on planting more saplings and protecting them. Are even 10% of the saplings, which were planted before, alive?”

Meanwhile, three RJD legislators — Gaighat MLA Maheshwar Prasad Yadav, Keoti MLA Faraz Fatmi and MLC Sanjay Prasad — will join the human chain on Sunday. They have also urged their followers to come forward to support the government’s initiative to protect the environment.

“I have openly declared that I will join the human chain at Chakai in Jamui district,” MLC Prasad told TOI.

Faraz said, “The human chain will be formed to create awareness and protect the environment. It, therefore, has my full support. I even went to Keoti with the district magistrate of Darbhanga to appeal to people to join the human chain.”

The RJD’s top leadership, including its president Lalu Prasad and leader of opposition, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, have opposed the human chain and asked their supporters not to join it. Tejashwi, in a tweet, attacked the CM for hiring 15 helicopters and spending crores only to take photographs of the event.

Chief minister Yogi Adityanath hands over a cheque to a farmer in Lucknow on Monday

LUCKNOW: At a time when BJP is under fire by the Opposition for bringing in what they call a divisive citizenship law, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday said his party does not “indulge in appeasement like others”.

Speaking at an event in Lucknow where the government handed over keys to recipients of houses under the Mukhya Mantri Awas Yojana, Yogi said the slogan of ‘sabka saath, sabha vikas’ was a reality with BJP-led governments which work for everyone’s development without any discrimination. “Those who accuse us of discrimination must introspect. If they had worked for the development of all without any discrimination, the current scenario would have been different,” he said.

Attacked by the Opposition for violence in UP during anti-citizenship law, the CM added that their desperation was “visible in their allegations”. He said: “People have evicted them from power due to their misdeeds and they are not going to return to power again anytime soon. At this time, their useless commentary on various issues is natural. These people who are making accusations against us have actually looted the deprived.”

Governor Anandiben Patel, who also attended the programme, said only a poor or saint can understand the pain of the poor, adding: “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has seen poverty and Yogiji is a saint.”

On Monday morning, while paying his respects to former PM Chaudhary Charan Singh on his 117th birth anniversary, the CM targeted the Opposition once again saying that while they kept taking Singh’s name, they did nothing for the farmers for whom Singh dedicated his life.

“Due to the apathy and carelessness of previous governments, farmers were neglected. Irrespective of the support price, farmers would be paid only Rs 900 to Rs 1,000 for one quintal of paddy. This year, the state government is paying Rs 1,835 of paddy directly to the farmer’s account,” he said.

KOLKATA: “There is a big struggle between the forces of democracy and fascism , where the situation in the country is that of civil war where only one side is armed,” said Prabhat Patnaik, emeritus professor of JNU, at a programme at Jadavpur University on Friday.

Universities across the country are under attack by those aligned to the right-wing ideology because they are leading the fight against fascism,” the economist and political commentator said, adding, “A united political opposition is the need of the hour.”

“The government has money for NPR, CAA and NRC, but they don’t have money to finance higher education. They are taking education cess from the public, but doing away with the grants.

JAMMU: The Congress ' Jammu and Kashmir unit on Sunday alleged that seeds of "" divisive politics "" were being sown in the socio-political fabric of the Union territory and promised that it would confront with all its political might the forces doing so.

JKPCC vice-president GM Saroori alleged that a few leaders have a long-cherished dream of reaping political dividends from ""divisiveness and polarisation"".

Maharashtra: Ajit Pawar says he knew only some VIDC contractors,"This story is from December 22, 2019

Ajit Pawar

Former water resources minister Ajit Pawar , in one of his last six replies furnished before Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB), said he only knew some contractors engaged by Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation (VIDC).

Pawar, who earlier replied to 52 ACB queries, sent the additional replies on December 3. He stated that he had no knowledge about the PIL being filed, highlighting alleged irregularities in irrigation projects in Vidarbha and Konkan. There were five PILs being filed by NGO Janmanch and activist Atul Jagtap.

Pawar distanced himself from tender cost updation, stating that there was no proposal before him for action against any engineer regarding that. The activists had claimed there was cost escalation of around Rs 17,700 crore in at least 32 irrigation projects within three months.

On advance mobilization of funds, Pawar replied that it was the responsibility of executivelevel officers. He denied knowing that there was no provision for advance mobilization. He denied knowing much about objections raised by Vadnere and Mendigiri committees into alleged irregularities in irrigation projects of Nagpur and Amravati division.

The latest facts in Pawar’s six replies come close on the heels of ACB closing nine cases involving 12 projects of VIDC for want of incriminating criminal evidence. There is also a proposal to close 45 more; 2,656 tenders of those projects were under the scanner. The probe into 212 tenders took place, following which 24 FIRs were registered and charge-sheets were filed in five cases. ACB had filed an affidavit this month, stating that no criminal liability was found on the part of (then) VIDC chairman (Pawar) in granting sanction to 100 tenders out of 302 which Nagpur division probed. The probe in another 202 is on. The affidavit said Pawar had only signed notesheets put up by VIDC officials. The affidavit was prepared on November 28, a day after MVA was formed.

Mobilisation of resources for waiver of loans Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray’s major challenge,"Uddhav Thackeray

MUMBAI: Nearly a month after he took over the reins, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray declared a loan waiver scheme to tackle agrarian crisis. The major challenge for him will be mobilisation of resources for implementation of the scheme.A senior bureaucrat told TOI on Saturday that it will require at least Rs 25,000 crore for implementing the loan waiver scheme for 38 lakh farmers, who have taken loan up to Rs 2 lakh.“As per records provided by the financial institutions and cooperation department, we have 38 lakh farmers, who have secured loan up to Rs 2 lakh. We will have to make the payment to the financial institutions to make farmers debt-free,’’ he said.The bureaucrat said in the run-up to the Lok Sabha election, followed by state assembly polls, Thackeray had declared that farmers will be debt-free and a financial assistance of Rs 25,000 per hectare will be given to the farmers affected by unseasonal rain in August, September and October. After the assembly election, when Thackeray took over reins, pressure was mounting on him to provide financial relief to the aggrieved farmers.“Ever since he took over on November 28, Thackeray had a series of meetings with officials of the financial institutions, cooperation, relief and rehabilitation and agriculture department on providing financial assistance to farmers. Ultimately, it was decided to waive off loan up to Rs 2 lakh from March 2020. A scheme for complete loan waiver too is being worked out and will be declared at appropriate time,”’ he said.In the event that Thackeray decides in favour of complete loan waiver, it will cost Rs 1.08 lakh crore to the state exchequer, it will benefit 75 lakh farmers, who have taken loans from financial institutions in the past.He said the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had on June 26, 2017, declared loan waiver scheme for 79 lakh farmers for Rs 3,43,022 crore. Later, it was found that data was wrong and actual number of farmers, who had taken loan stood at 69 lakh. As on December 15, loans of Rs 19,115 of 45 lakh farmers have been waived.Fadnavis’s scheme was implemented from March 2016, while the new scheme will be implemented from March 2015 and up to September 2019.The bureaucrat said the Fadnavis’s scheme failed to take off owing to too many formalities and online application system, while in the present system there is no need for a farmer to apply. Instead the entire loan amount will be deposited in his account, provided his account number is linked to Aadhar card.","Uddhav ThackerayMUMBAI: Nearly a month after he took over the reins, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray declared a loan waiver scheme to tackle agrarian crisis.

Devendra Fadnavis government didn’t submit grant utilisation certs: CAG,"This story is from December 22, 2019

Devendra Fadnavis

MUMBAI: The CAG has passed stringent strictures against the erstwhile state government led by Devendra Fadnavis for its failure to submit utilisation certificates for grants worth Rs 65,921crore, prolonged delay in completion of irrigation projects and inability to close or revive sick state-run understandings, resulting in accumulated losses of Rs 49,192 crore.

NCP president Sharad Pawar demanded a high-level probe into the departments which failed to submit utilization certificate within the stipulated period and financial indiscipline, while finance and planning minister Jayant Patil said offences will be registered against erring officials for dereliction of duty.

In its report on finances of the state government tabled in both the houses of the state legislature on Friday, the CAG submitted that the Bombay Financial Rules, 1959, provide that for grants received during a year for specific purpose, utilization certificate should be obtained by the departmental officers from the grantee institution and it should be forwarded to the accountant general office within 12 months from the date of their sanction. CAG found that 32,570 utilization certificates aggregating to Rs 65,921.35 crore in respect of grants released between 2015 to 2018 were not submitted to the accountant general’s office.

The majority cases of non-submission of UCs related to the urban development (46 per cent), school education and sports and planning (eight per cent each), public health (seven), tribal development (six), industries and rural development (five each) and dairy development (four per cent). Non submission of UCs defeats the very purpose of legislative control over the public purse and is fraught with the risk of the funds released for various scheme/ programmes being locked up or diverted.

“Non submission of UCs indicated lack of proper monitoring by the department in utilization of grants sanctioned for specific purposes. Further, there was no assurance that the money was actually incurred during the financial year for the purpose for which it was sanctioned/ authorized by legislature. High pendency of UCs was fraught with the risk of misappropriation of funds and fraud,” the CAG observed.

On the prolonged delay in execution of irrigation projects, the CAG pointed out that it invites the risk of escalation in the cost of the works, besides, due to delay in completion of projects, the intended benefits from those projects did not reach the beneficiaries. It was found that 67 projects were delayed for more than 30 years, 75 by 20 to 30 years, 56 by15 to 20 years, 69 by 10 to 15 years, 131 by five to 10 years, two by up to five years and in 12 cases, work is yet to start.

LS Speaker Om Birla with CM Yogi Adityanath in UP assembly in Lucknow on Thursday

LUCKNOW: Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Thursday exhorted lawmakers to rise to the expectations of the people and deliver.

Inaugurating the two-day , seventh edition of Commonwealth Parliamentary Association , India Chapter Conference at UP Assembly, Birla said a vibrant democracy was the soul of the nation and more and more countries watching India as the largest democracy on the globe were opting for a democratic system of governance.

Birla pointed out that the rising poll percentage in elections was a strong indicator of the immovable faith of the people of India in democracy. He said that the increasing faith of the people in democracy had thrust more responsibility on the representatives of the public and they should deliver, perform and rise to the expectations of their constituents. On the occasion, UP Assembly Speaker Hriday Narain Dixit recalled the moment when PM Narendra Modi , stepping into Parliament for the first time in 2014, had bowed before it sending a strong message on the significance of the ""temple of democracy"" and the Constitution of India being inviolate.

Expressing concern over the deterioration in functioning of the House in recent past, Dixit hoped that the two-day CPA conference would give a direction for improvement. Special guest of the inaugural function, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said that he was confident that the outcome of the CPA conference after the two-day deliberations would help in strengthening democracy and parliamentary functioning. Yogi said that under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, the nation was making strides in development and welfare of the people of India. He hoped that the representatives of the people would shed their political differences to work for the development of the country.

Leader of the Opposition, Ram Govind Chaudhary emphasised upon unity in diversity of the nation. MP governor Lalji Tandon, who had been a member of the UP Assembly in the past also addressed the conference, while former speakers Mata Prasad Pandey and Keshari Nath Tripathi were also invited for the inaugural function along with majority of the speakers of the state legislative assemblies and other dignitaries and representatives of the other Commonwealth nations.

Political storm brews in Kerala again,"This story is from November 15, 2019

NEW DELHI: With no resolution of the Sabarimala impasse in sight as yet, Kerala is expected to see another round of political tensions as the government prepares for the Mandala festival in Sabarimala beginning November 17.

While the LDF government remained cautious in its reaction to the apex court’s ruling on Sabarimala and said it will seek legal opinion on the “ambiguity” in the apex court’s decision to maintain status quo, BJP and Congress seized the opportunity to attack the Left-ruled government and said it must ensure the ensuing festival season remains peaceful and that the devotees are not disturbed.

Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala advised the ruling dispensation to “not create issues” by attempting to provide security to women who attempt to forcibly enter the shrine against the prevailing tradition. BJP MP and junior minister for external affairs, V Muraleedharan, attacked the Left government for saying it would seek legal advice on the Sabarimala judgment. “This is only an attempt by the Left to make troublemakers infiltrate Sabarimala,” he said on Twitter.

Congress general secretary and former MP KC Venugopal advised the Left government to exercise restraint. “Respecting the SC’s decision, I would request the (state government) to show restraint in the matter till the seven-judge bench gives its verdict. The government must ensure a peaceful pilgrimage season,” he said on Twitter.

The Sabarimala shrine reopens for devotees on November 17 for the Mandala festival, which leaves the ruling LDF government with little time to settle on a strategy to handle the issue. While Left sources acknowledged that CPM’s obdurate stand on Sabarimala have impacted its electoral prospects — it was reduced to one out of 20 seats in Lok Sabha in the 2019 polls — party insiders accepted they find themselves cornered, leaving the government with little choice but to implement the Supreme Court’s orders to facilitate safe entry for all devotees.

With a new festival season around the corner, while Congress and BJP, are presented with a renewed opportunity to capitalise on popular sentiment, the Left finds itself struggling to strike a balance between mass sentiment and administrative propriety.

Gujarat CM seeks plan for development of Vishwamitri area,"This story is from December 21, 2019

Vijay Rupani

VADODARA/GANDHINAGAR: The Vishwamitri river project may finally see the light of day.

Chief minister Vijay Rupani held a high-level meeting on Friday to discuss the development plan for the river and directed officials to chalk out a comprehensive plan for making holistic development of entire river area of Vishwamitri River from its origin at Pavagadh to its amalgamation with Gulf of Khambhat.

Vishwamitri that flows through Vadodara has been a cause of concern due to flooding periodically and pollution.

Sewage flows through the river and plans to rejuvenate it have moved at a snail’s pace.

Things, however, may change now with Rupani emphasizing at the meeting that it is very essential to chalk out a comprehensive plan for Vishwamitri to ensure that it doesn’t affect life of people of Vadodara city due to floods. The CM suggested to officials of Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) that the plan should ensure that water flows into the river throughout the year so as to enhance the beauty and green cover in the city.

Rupani suggested that the project should turn out to be a role model in the country with its holistic approach and flood mitigation.

He asked the VMC to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) through a world-class agency at the earliest and it should also be sent to the Centre for financial assistance with a sharing ratio of 60-40 between the central and state governments.

The meeting was attended by VMC mayor Dr Jigisha Sheth, adviser to CM (water resources) B N Navlawala, chief principal secretary K Kailashnathan, additional chief secretary (urban development) Mukesh Puri, principal secretary to CM M K Das, VMC commissioner Nalin Upadhyay and chairman of Vadodara-based Community Science Centre M H Mehta. Mehta has also been at the forefront of Vaho Vishwmitri Abhiyaan that is working for an environment-friendly and sustainable approach to the project.

Political war of words erupts over distribution of ration through PDS,"Keeping it clean: Workers engaged by NMC during fogging and sanitation drive on Thursday

Nagpur: BJP leaders have lodged a complaint with the district administration pointing out several lapses in the public distribution system (PDS). This seems to be a fall out of a political war between BJP and Congress. BJP leader Virendra Kukreja has alleged that Congress workers were appropriating the rations meant for poor people.

Meanwhile, guardian minister Nitin Raut has written a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray urging him to immediately issue an order whereby poor people who do not have ration cards should also get food grains under PDS.

Vijay Zalke, standing committee chairman of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), met district collector Ravindra Thakre on Thursday morning and pointed out several lacunae.

According to the memorandum submitted by him, many people have ration cards but as they are not online they are having problems in getting ration. Also, there are some people who have ration cards issued in places other than Nagpur. They too are not getting food grains. Same is the case with tenants who are natives of other places. Zalke has asked whether only Ujjwala Scheme beneficiaries would get free gas cylinders.

Kukreja alleged in a press note that district collector Thakre had made only Congress workers as the local distribution agents of ration. “He did not discuss it with other political parties and acted under the influence of the guardian minister. It is unfortunate such cheap politics is being done when a pandemic is raging in the country,” he told TOI.

Kukreja further said that Congress workers had practically captured ration shops and were distributing ration to only their supporters. He has released a list of Congress workers appointed as local distributors by the administration.

Ravindra Khazanchi, resident deputy collector, refuted the allegations and said that food grains were being provided under PDS through government mechanism and workers of any political party did not have any role in it. “Ration is being distributed smoothly and we have not received any complaint from the beneficiaries,” he added.

BJP: Shiv Sena tweaking civic contracts to favour some,"This story is from December 20, 2019

Representative image

MUMBAI: BJP corporators accused former ally, Shiv Sena , of helping senior civic officials to adopt corrupt practices in BMC, by conducting an official meeting in the office of a contractor and changing conditions in tenders to favours some bidders.

BJP MP Manoj Kotak, who is also a corporator, boycotted the standing committee meeting along with fellow party corporators on Thursday, after they were not allowed to speak on the issue. Kotak alleged that Sena corporators and senior civic officials were exerting pressure on junior officials to award contracts at 40% higher rate to select contractors, causing a loss to BMC.

Standing committee chairman Yashwant Jadhav (Sena) said, “They wanted to speak on some issue without following rules. I told them to discuss if after an important subject, but they left. It was not important. For the first time, BJP behaved like this. I am surprised with their behaviour.”

Standing committee member Prabhakar Shinde (BJP) sought a discussion on an objectionable procedure adopted by the committee by conducting a civic meeting at a contractor’s office in central Mumbai on December 9. Jadhav did not allow the discussion, after which members walked out.

Shinde said, “We wanted to discuss the wrong procedure, where standing committee members were called to a consultant’s office for a meeting in the presence of the contractor. It’s a bad practice. When BMC has so many halls and premises to arrange meetings, where was the need to call the meeting at a private office in the presence of contractors.”

BMC chief Praveen Pardeshi and other senior civic officials were present at the controversial meeting. Kotak said.

Jadhav rubbished the claim, stating that his party will ensure no manipulated tender gets cleared.
